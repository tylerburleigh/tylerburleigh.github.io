  "description": "DescriptionAbout HCII and CMU\nThe Human-Computer Interaction Institute is a living laboratory where we explore the interplay between computer technology, human activity, and society. Founded in 1993, HCII focuses on designing and creating technology that harmonizes with and enhances human capabilities, goals, and social environments. Through interdisciplinary research and education spanning design, computer science, and behavioral and social sciences, we investigate how people work, play, and communicate within groups, organizations, and broader social structures. We then design, create, and evaluate technologies and tools to support these human and social activities.\n \nFlexibility, excellence, and passion are key qualities within HCII. At CMU, inclusion, collaboration, and cultural sensitivity are core values. We seek a team member who can effectively engage with a diverse population of internal and external partners with integrity and who shares our mission to create a positive impact through their work.\nThe Computation & Collective Lab, led by Hirokazu Shirado, seeks to hire a postdoctoral fellow to collaborate on cutting-edge research in intergroup cooperation with machine intelligence. The position is set to begin in the Summer or Fall of 2025 and is based within the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science. It is offered as a one-year contract, with the possibility of renewal based on performance and funding availability.\n \nAbout the Lab and Research Focus:\nOur lab is at the forefront of exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) influences interpersonal coordination and cooperation. We are dedicated to developing innovative AI interventions that address social dilemmas and facilitate public goods in group settings. For more details on our past work, see this link.\n \nThe postdoctoral fellow will lead a project involving online experiments to study interpersonal communication, cooperation, and group formation in the presence of AI. A central focus will be on developing and testing large language model (LLM)-powered tools to facilitate these interactions, particularly in intergroup contexts, such as between individuals with differing political ideologies or cognitive profiles.QualificationsApplicants must hold a doctoral degree in their discipline by the start of this position.  We are seeking candidates from diverse backgrounds, such as social sciences, human-computer interaction, psychology, computer science, or related fields.\nIdeal candidates should demonstrate the ability to:\n•                    Apply social and behavioral science theories to computer science applications.\n•                    Develop software utilizing large language models (LLMs) and machine learning.\n•                    Design and conduct web-based social experiments.\n•                    Lead data analysis and create insightful visualizations.\n•                    Author high-quality research papers and grant proposals.\nThat said, the most important qualification is a genuine enthusiasm for exploring how AI can be designed and deployed to address fundamental social challenges. The applicant’s field of study is not as important as experiences and perspectives that can contribute to new ways of thinking about these complex issues.Application InstructionsTo apply, please submit the following materials via the “Apply Now” link:\n                •             A short cover letter describing your interests and experiences.\n                •             Your CV.\n                •             Contact information for three references.\n \nIf you have any questions or would like to express your interest, feel free to email shirado@cmu.edu directly.\n Equal Employment Opportunity StatementCarnegie Mellon University shall abide by the requirements of 41 CFR §§ 60-1.4(a), 60-300.5(a) and 60-741.5(a). These regulations prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals based on their status as protected veterans or individuals with disabilities, and prohibit discrimination against all individuals based on their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Moreover, these regulations require that covered prime contractors and subcontractors take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment individuals without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, protected veteran status or disability.",
