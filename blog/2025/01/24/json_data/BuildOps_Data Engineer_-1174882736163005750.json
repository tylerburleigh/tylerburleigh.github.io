Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking commercial contractors from the world of pen and paper operations to digitized, efficient, data-driven business.</p>\n<p>Our co-founders have over a decade of experience in both construction and SaaS technology, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful startup exits, including a $1.2 billion acquisition.</p>\n<p>BuildOps has raised multiple rounds of funding from some of the largest and most reputable Venture Capital firms, including Founders Fund, Fika Ventures, and Greenspring Associates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicakrystledonati/2019/11/01/the-skyrocketing-contech-sector-is-capturing-new-market-segments/#6da9ca9cb977\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong><em>Forbes Magazine</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong></a>“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/los-angeles-based-buildops-subcontracting-software-for-real-estate-raises-5-8-million/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong><em>TechCrunch</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong></a>“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/canadas-renorun-raises-17-1m-series-a-for-its-construction-material-delivery-app/1000/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong><em>Crunchbase</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong></a>In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wall Street Journal [Paywall]</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong>BuildOps, the Santa Monica, California, startup that provides software for real estate subcontractors was seeded with $5.8 million in funding from investors including Fika Ventures, MetaProp VC, Global Founders Capital, CrossCut Ventures, TenOneTen, IGSB, 1984 Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures and Ground Up Ventures.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div
