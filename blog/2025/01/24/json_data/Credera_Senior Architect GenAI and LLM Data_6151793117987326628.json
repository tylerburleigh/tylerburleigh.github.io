Our one-of-a-kind global boutique approach means we provide our clients with tailored solutions unique to their organization that can scale due to our extensive footprint. As a values-led organization, our mission is to make an extraordinary impact on our clients, our people, and our community. We believe it is this approach that has allowed us to work with and transform the most influential brands and organizations in the world, from strategy through to execution.<br/>More information is available at <a href=\"https://www.credera.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.credera.com</a>. <br/>We are part of the OPMG Group of Companies, a division of Omnicom Group Inc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid Work Model:</strong></p>\n<p>Our employees have the flexibility to work remotely two days per week. We expect our team members to spend 3 days per week in person with the flexibility to choose the days and times that work best for both them and their project or internal teams. This could be at a Credera office or at the client site. You'll work closely with your project team to align on how you balance both the flexibility that we want to provide with the connection of being together to produce amazing results for our clients.</p>\n<p>The Why: We are passionate about growing our people both personally and professionally. Our philosophy is that in-person engagement is critical for our ability to develop deep relationships with our clients and our team members – it's how we earn trust, learn from others, and ultimately become better consultants and professionals.</p>\n<p>Travel : Our goal is to keep out-of-market travel to a minimum and most projects do not require significant travel. While certain projects can require frequent travel (up to 80% for a period of time), our average travel percentage over a year for team members is typically between 10-30%. We try to take a personal approach to travel. You will submit your travel preferences which our staffing teams will take into account when aligning you to a role.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Credera will never ask for money up front and will not use apps such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or Google Hangouts for communicating with you. You should be very wary of, and carefully scrutinize, any job opportunity that asks for money prior to starting and/or one where all communications take place exclusively via chat.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"d-grid gap-2 mb-4\">\n  \n  <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-apply-now\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/J950183/apply/\" rel=\"nofollow noindex\"><i
