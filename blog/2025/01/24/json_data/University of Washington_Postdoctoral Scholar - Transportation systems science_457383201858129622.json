  "description": "DescriptionThe THINK lab is looking for an enthusiastic, self-motivated Postdoctoral Scholar researcher with demonstrated capability and interest in conducting big data and mobility analysis and/or infrastructure systems analysis. Though it is desirable that the candidate has the skills and interest in conducting both kinds of analyses, applications from those with an interest in primarily one of them are also welcome. \nResearch in big data/mobility analysis seeks to answer questions such as: \n\nHow biases and uncertainties in big data affect the derived mobility and accessibility metrics that are often used for making transportation related decisions? \nHow do travelers respond to personalized rewards? \nHow to design transit related systems that can adapt to a range of external conditions? \n\nResearch in infrastructure systems analysis seeks to answer questions such as: \n\nWhere does adaptability exist in different urban systems (e.g., land use, food systems, human behaviors and transit related systems? \nWhen multiple systems of different scales are coupled together, how does that promote or hinder adaptability? \nHow to leverage community assets to promote resilience and adaptability at the local scale? \n\nApplicants should have demonstrated capabilities and programming skills that are needed to answer the whole or a subset of the above questions. \nInterested applicants are encouraged to contact Cynthia Chen (qzchen@uw.edu) to discuss their interests in this position prior to the application deadline.
