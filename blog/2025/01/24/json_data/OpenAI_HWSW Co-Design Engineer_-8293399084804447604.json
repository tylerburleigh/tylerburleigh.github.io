  "description": "About the TeamOur mission at OpenAI is to discover and enact the path to safe, beneficial AGI. To do this, we believe that many technical breakthroughs are needed in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, large scale optimization, active learning, among other topics.The Research Platform team builds robust and scalable software to support our research efforts. It also offers core development services for mission critical goals and applications. We’re forming a new team to work with our partners on hardware optimization and co-design, and are looking for founding engineers. This team will be responsible for working with partners to optimize their hardware for our workloads, identifying promising new deep learning accelerators, and bringing those hardware platforms to production.About the RoleAs an Engineer on our Hardware Team, you will co-design future hardware from different vendors for programmability and performance. You will work with our kernel, compiler and machine learning engineers to understand their needs related to ML techniques, algorithms, numerical approximations, programming expressivity, and compiler optimizations. You will evangelize these constraints with various vendors to develop future hardware architectures amenable for efficient training and inference. If you are excited about maximizing HBM bandwidth, optimizing for low arithmetic intensity, expressive SIMD ISA, low-precision formats, optimizing for memory hierarchies, simulating workloads at various resolutions of the hardware and evangelizing these ideas with hardware engineers, this is the perfect opportunity!This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.In this role, you will:Co-design future hardware for programmability and performance with our hardware vendorsAssist hardware vendors in developing optimal kernels and add support for it in our compilerDevelop performance estimates for critical kernels for different hardware configurations Work with machine learning engineers, kernel engineers and compiler developers to understand their vision and needs from high performance acceleratorsManage communication and coordination with internal and external partnersInfluence the roadmap of hardware partners to optimize them for OpenAI’s workloads.Evaluate potential partners’ accelerators and platforms.Build simulations and performance models to progressively improve decision making fidelity.As the scope of the role and team grows, understand and influence roadmaps for hardware partners for our datacenter networks, racks, and buildings.You might thrive in this role if you:4+ years of industry experience, including experience harnessing compute at scale or building semiconductors.Strong experience in software/hardware co-designDeep understanding of GPU and/or other AI acceleratorsExperience with CUDA or a related accelerator programming languageExperience driving Machine Learning accuracy with low precision formatsExperience aligning future hardware with a well established HPC infrastructureAre familiar with the fundamentals of deep learning computing and chip microarchitecture.Able to actively collaborate with ML engineers, kernel writers and compiler developersThese attributes are nice to have:PhD in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing. Compilers or other SystemsStrong coding skills in C/C++ and PythonStrong understanding of LLMs and challenges related to their training and inference Benefits and PerksMedical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your familyMental health and wellness support401(k) plan with 4% matchingUnlimited time off and 18+ company holidays per yearPaid parental leave (20 weeks) and family-planning supportAnnual learning & development stipend ($1,500 per year)About OpenAIOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.
