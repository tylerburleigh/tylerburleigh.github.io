  "description": "Who we are:\nOur name is inspired by Theodore Roosevelt’s ‘Citizenship in a Republic’ speech, which pays homage to the ‘(hu)man in the Arena’. To us, entering the Arena means committing oneself fully and accepting the risk of failure in the pursuit of an audacious, worthy cause.\nWe’re a close-knit tribe of scientists and builders exploring the boundaries of how artificial intelligence can benefit humanity. If you share our passion for delving deep into real-world problems and solving them with fully autonomous AI, join us in the Arena.\nWhat we do:\nOur collective future is being built in the physical world, but the builders of tomorrow’s technology can no longer rely on yesterday’s tools. At Arena, we’re building the world’s first AI industrial engineer designed to solve the most complex hardware and manufacturing challenges. Our product, Atlas, is built with an understanding of the behavior of physical systems, powered by a superior knowledge of core domains of physics. Paired with its ability to reason about multimodal industrial data, Atlas can test, debug, optimize, and repair physical systems and products in the real world. Arena is already trusted by some of the most advanced industrial companies in the world (AMD, Bausch & Lomb), and we're rapidly already scaling into the defense, automotive, and pharmaceuticals industries, and we’re just getting started.\nHow we work:\n\nAll technical staff at Arena forward deploy internationally to work with our customers face-to-face - expect some domestic and international travel. When in NYC, we work full-time in our office at 35 E 21st Street.\nEngineering at Arena is comprehensive. Everyone works across the stack when needed, including work outside of engineering, to reach outcomes. \n\nAbout the role: \nAre you excited about building something from the ground up? Energized by developing AI that transforms how we build in the physical world? Intrigued by a role that spans a wide spectrum of Electrical Engineering tasks and beyond? If so, we are looking for you to join us in the Arena as our first Electrical Engineering hire. \nYou will play a mission-critical role in designing, building,  and operationalizing a circuit testing lab from the ground up. From designing and implementing automated testing processes to creating, simulating, debugging, and testing circuits, you can define the future of EE at Arena. With your lead, we will define best practices, establish a quality bar, and set the foundation for massive growth. In close collaboration with our ML scientists, software engineers, and product teams, you will directly shape our product platform ATLAS for the electrical engineering domain. A truly unique role, at the intersection of hardware and software, in one of the most exciting fields and times to do it. \nHow you will contribute:\nDesign, build & test circuits (PCBs)\n\nYou’ll work on prototype boards – scaled down versions of commercial PCBs for automotive, aerospace and personal computers. \n\nBuild our EE test lab\n\nSource and setup testing equipment, run maintenance, calibration tasks for oscilloscopes, DAQs, power sources, sensors, load simulators, digital communication interfaces\nDesign and build automatic test execution scripts / software and integrate into existing our ATLAS product platform using python, LabView, SCPI, etc.\n\nDesign and execute experiments\n\nTest, debug and root cause PCB failures using our EE test lab and standard tooling (see more on tooling in experience section below)\nExpand our test lab to improve controls and measurement for common failure modes (e.g., environmental conditions, circuit characteristics, EMI / EMC)\n\nServe as the domain expert and primary collaborator with software engineering and ML teams working on building AI systems that understand EE\nTravel domestically and internationally (up to 25% of your time)\nWork in person at Arena's NYC headquarters when not traveling\nYou Have:\n\n5+ years of professional experience as an electrical engineer (design and/or test) working in industry – at a leading company in Aerospace, Automotive or Semiconductors\nIdeally, you like to tinker and build things yourself, e.g., robotics, ham radios, RC cars/planes/drones. You’re familiar with hobbyist hardware, e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Nvidia Jetson\nYou’ve worked with standard EDA and simulation tools – Cadence, Synopsys, Ansys, and are familiar with SPICE, PDN and Verilog-AMS\nYou’re familiar with debugging and root causing EMI / EM parasitics\nGenuine enthusiasm and interest to apply Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning to real-world applications\nYou are familiar with programming/scripting and have used it regularly in your work to date – e.g., Python, NI LabView, Matlab\nYou thrive in team environments, are a strong communicator and have demonstrated that you can collaborate well with others from different functions/ specialities\nYou are scrappy, and hands-on, and eager to build things from 0 to 1 \n\nBenefits & Perks Include:\n\n99% of the monthly premium for Aetna medical insurance, plus vision and dental coverage\n401(k) Retirement Plan\nUnlimited PTO\nLunch every day from local restaurants via Sharebite\nRelocation support provided \n\nThe base salary range for this position is $150,000 - $200,000 yr. However, base pay offered may vary depending on job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. In addition to base salary, we also offer competitive equity and benefits packages.",
