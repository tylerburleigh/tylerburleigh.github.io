  "description": "Reality Labs at Meta is seeking Research Scientists with experience in product-focused machine learning and signal processing research to advance our pioneering work in neuromotor interfaces, which has grown out of the acquisition of CTRL-labs. We’re building a practical interface drawing on the rich neuromotor signals that can be measured non-invasively via surface electromyography (EMG) with single motor neuron resolution. This technology could become one of the main pillars for interaction with virtual and augmented worlds.We are a multi-disciplinary team of researchers investigating the nature of human neuromotor signals, developing novel signal processing and machine learning methods to infer a user’s intent, and creating novel interaction techniques and user experiences. Help us unleash human potential by removing the bottlenecks between user intent and action.Research Scientist, Neural Interfaces (PhD) ResponsibilitiesDesign methods, tools and infrastructure to analyze and leverage rich multimodal data sets.Help transition algorithms and metrics from research into production.Analyze and develop metrics for deep learning models and experimental datasetsDesign experiments, involving human participants, to assess model performance.Minimum QualificationsCurrently has or is in the process of obtaining a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Statistics/Mathematics, or related field.Programming experience in Python and hands-on experience with frameworks such as PyTorch.Experience with architectural patterns of large scale software applications.Must obtain work authorization in country of employment at the time of hire, and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment.Currently has, or is in the process of obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, relevant technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
