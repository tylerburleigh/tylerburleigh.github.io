Our research powers open platforms and tools that assist scholars in performing scientific research tasks (e.g., literature discovery and synthesis, hypothesis generation, etc.) such as the Semantic Scholar platform and intelligent research assistants.  We regularly publish in high-profile conferences and journals in NLP (e.g., ACL, EMNLP), HCI (e.g., CHI, UIST, CSCW), ML (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR), IR (e.g., SIGIR), Accessibility (ASSETS), and other areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Next Challenge:</strong></p>\n<p>Research engineers on our team contribute to Ai2's impact-driven mission in an exciting, fast-paced research environment. </p>\n<p>The essential functions include, but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build infrastructure that powers groundbreaking research with real-world impact on accelerating science</li>\n<li>Conduct ML/AI/HCI experiments for research projects</li>\n<li>Implement and share open-source software to improve access to our research,</li>\n<li>Collaborate with and learn from team members across Ai2, including scientists and engineers, </li>\n<li>Mentor early-career researchers, engineers,  and interns on their projects, and</li>\n<li>Contribute toward scientific papers for publication in high-profile computing conferences and journals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2+ years of experience implementing machine learning or AI (including at least one year of prompt engineering and/or fine-tuning large language models), some of which ends up in production in front of users.</li>\n<li>Strong software engineering skills.  Experience with system building (e.g., web application frameworks) or deep learning frameworks (e.g., <a href=\"https://aijobs.net/insights/pytorch-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">PyTorch</a>, Tensorflow). Contributions to open-source research libraries (e.g., spaCy, Hugging Face’s Transformers) are a plus.</li>\n<li>A passion for using AI to deliver high-quality products and user experiences</li>\n<li>BS or higher in Computer Science or a related field (MS a plus), with a specific focus on one or more of our team’s active research areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Physical Demands and Work Environment:</strong></p>\n<p>The physical demands described here are representative of those that must be met by a team member to successfully perform the essential functions of this position. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the functions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must be able to remain in a stationary position for long periods of time. </li>\n<li>The ability to communicate information and ideas so others will understand. Must be able to exchange accurate information in these situations. </li>\n<li>The ability to observe details at close range.</li>\n<li>Can work under deadlines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A Little More About Ai2:</strong></p>\n<p>Ai2 is a Seattle based non-profit AI research institute founded in 2014 by the late Paul Allen. Our mission is building breakthrough AI to solve the world’s biggest problems. We develop foundational AI research and innovation to deliver real-world impact through large-scale open models, data, robotics, conservation, and beyond.</p>\n<p>In addition to Ai2’s core mission, we also aim to contribute to humanity through our treatment of each member of the Ai2 Team. Some highlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We are a learning organization </strong>– because everything Ai2 does is ground-breaking, we are learning every day. Similarly, through weekly Ai2 Academy lectures, a wide variety of world-class AI experts as guest speakers, and our commitment to your personal on-going education, Ai2 is a place where you will have opportunities to continue learning alongside your coworkers. </li>\n<li><strong>We value diversity - </strong>We seek to hire, support, and promote people from all genders, ethnicities, and all levels of experience regardless of age. We particularly encourage applications from women, non-binary individuals, people of color, members of the LGBTQA+ community, and people with disabilities of any kind. </li>\n<li><strong>We value inclusion - </strong>We understand the value that people's individual experiences and perspectives can bring to an organization, and we are building a culture in which all voices are heard, respected and considered.</li>\n<li><strong>We emphasize a healthy work/life balance </strong>– we believe our team members are happiest and most productive when their work/life balance is optimized. While we value powerful research results which drive our mission forward, we also value dinner with family, weekend time, and vacation time. We offer generous paid vacation and sick leave as well as family leave.</li>\n<li><strong>We are collaborative and transparent </strong>– we consider ourselves a team, all moving with a common purpose. We are quick to cheer our successes, and even quicker to share and jointly problem solve our failures.</li>\n<li><strong>We are in Seattle </strong>– and our office is on the water! We have mountains, we have lakes, we have four seasons, we bike to work, we have a vibrant theater scene, and we have so much else. We even have kayaks for you to paddle right outside our front door. We welcome interest from applicants from outside of the United States.</li>\n<li><strong>We are friendly</strong>– chances are you will like every one of the 200+ (and growing) people who work here. We do. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ai2 is proud to be an Equal Opportunity employer.
