You will contribute to projects similar to our recent Molmo model release (https://molmo.allenai.org/).\nOur next hire will also help us build infrastructure one of the two: (1) the next generation of multimodal language models and digital agents or (2) simulation infrastructure for mobile robotics and real-world mobile robots. We’re looking for someone with experience working with open-source projects, deep knowledge of Python, and a strong understanding of modern deep learning, computer vision, and some natural language processing.\nWe are looking for applicants interested in computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, robotics, agents, and/or embodied AI. International candidates are welcome to apply. Pay is competitive, and visa sponsorship is available.\nWe collaborate frequently with researchers and engineers on other Ai2 teams focused on natural language processing and HCI, among others. Our main office has close ties and unique access to researchers at the University of Washington, only 1.5 miles away.
