The AC is a global community of academia, industry, and government that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, materials sciences, and high-throughput chemistry to create self-driving laboratories (SDLs), also called materials acceleration platforms (MAPs). These autonomous labs rapidly design materials and molecules needed for a sustainable, healthy, and resilient future, with applications ranging from renewable energy and consumer electronics to drugs. AC Staff Research Scientists will advance the field of AI-driven autonomous discovery and develop the materials and molecules required to address society’s largest challenges, such as climate change, water pollution, and future pandemics.\n \nThe Acceleration Consortium received a $200M Canadian First Research Excellence Grant for seven years to develop self-driving labs for chemistry and materials, the largest ever grant to a Canadian University. This grant will provide the Acceleration Consortium with seven years of funding to execute its vision.\n \nThe AC is developing seven advanced SDLs plus an AI and Automation lab:\n \n\nSDL1 - Inorganic solid-state compounds for advanced materials and energy\nSDL2 - Organic small molecules for sustainability and health\nSDL3 - Medicinal chemistry for improving small molecule drug candidates\nSDL4 - Polymers for materials science and biological applications \nSDL5 - Formulations for pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and coatings \nSDL6 - Biocompatibility with organoids / organ-on-a-chip\nSDL7 - Synthetic scale-up of materials and molecules (University of British Colombia partner lab)\nA central AI and Automation lab to support all the SDLs\n\n \nThis posted position is for a Staff Research Scientist within the AI and Automation Lab. \n \nExpertise in one or more of the following areas is desired:\n  \nAI and computational expertise\n\nAdaptive AI-driven closed-loop experimental design and analysis (such as with Bayesian optimization)\nAI-accelerated discovery of materials and molecules\nAccelerating first principles calculations of materials and molecules with AI\n\nAutomation / robotics expertise\n\nHigh-throughput experimentation (rapid serial and/or highly-parallel experimentation)\nLab automation and robotic manipulation of lab operations\n\t \n\nThe Staff Research Scientists will work with a diverse team of leading experts at U of T, including: Professors Anatole von Lilienfeld, Florian Shkurti, Animesh Garg, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Oleksandr Voznyy, and more.\n \nWe are hiring both Staff Scientists and Staff Research Scientists. While Staff Scientists are expected to have 5 years of post-PhD experience, individuals with a relevant Ph.D. and associated expertise can qualify for Staff Research Scientist.\n \nThe Staff Research Scientists involved in the AC are highly skilled and experienced researchers who will work independently to develop the AI and automation technologies required to build robust and scalable self-driving labs, manage these SDLs, and design and implement research programs (based on the direction of the AC’s scientific leadership team) that leverage the SDL platforms to discover materials and molecules. Moreover, the Staff Research Scientists will work collectively, sharing knowledge among each other, faculty, and trainees. This role will report to the Academic Director and Executive Director of the Acceleration Consortium.\n \nThe components and duties of the work can include:\n \n\nSDL and Automation Development\n\nWorking with the AC community, including faculty and partners, to determine the required capabilities of the SDLs to be built. Developing the plans for SDLs that will meet user requirements and designing novel instruments for automated material synthesis and characterization. Developing customized hardware and Python software packages to build SDLs. Selecting, procurement, and installation of the equipment required for SDLs.\n \n\nResearch Direction\n\nDevelop research programs that leverage the AC’s SDLs and support the research objectives of AC faculty and industry partners. Using SDLs to synthesize and characterize large quantities of candidate molecules, calibrating theoretical models with experimental data, predicting promising candidates with computational tools and machine learning algorithms, and elucidating structure-property relationships of emerging molecules, polymers, solid-state materials, formulations, etc.\n \nTasks include:  \n\nImplementing research and development projects of AC’s industry partners when implemented in AC labs.\nDeveloping plans that support research collaborations and planning and estimating financial resources required for programs and/or projects.\nWorking with Product Managers to ensure research outcomes meet partner requirements.\nPromoting AC’s research capacity, including delivering presentations at conferences.\nCollaboration in the preparation and submission of research proposals to granting agencies and progress reporting. \nPreparing manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed publications/journals and stewarding them through the process.\n\n Other\n\n\n\nSupporting consulting services related to the application of SDLs for materials discovery for the AC’s partners.\nSupport research-focused events such as the Annual Symposium.\n\n\n\n \nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:\n \nEducation – Ph.D. in computer science, engineering, chemistry, physics, life sciences, or related discipline\n \nExperience\n\n1 to 5 years of experience (inclusive of PhD and/or post-graduate work) in accelerated research and development with demonstrated academic and research excellence.\nExperience working with industry partners and on industry lead research and development projects. \nExpert knowledge of AI and automation and experience with the development of self-driving laboratories.\nExperience presenting research at academic conferences\n\n \nSkills\n\nStrong and effective communicator in oral and written English\nCollegial in working with team members and collaborators\nAbility to work independently\n\n \nOther\n\nMust have a strong publication record\nDemonstrated success in the writing and preparation of manuscripts, presentations, reports, briefs, and scientific abstracts and manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals.\n\nAll qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority\n \n \nClosing Date: 03/31/2025, 11:59PM ET\nEmployee Group: Research Associate\nAppointment Type: Grant - Term (2 years term with possibility of renewal)\nSchedule: Full-Time\nPay Scale Group & Hiring Zone: R01 -- Research Associates (Limited Term):  $52,574 - $98,576 (salary will be assessed and may go above the range based on skills and experience)\nJob Category: Research Administration & Teaching",
