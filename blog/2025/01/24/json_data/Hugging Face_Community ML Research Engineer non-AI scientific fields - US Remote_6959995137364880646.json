  "description": "At Hugging Face, we’re on a journey to democratize good AI. We are building the fastest growing platform for AI builders with over 5 million users & 100k organizations who collectively shared over 1M models, 300k datasets & 300k apps. Our open-source libraries have more than 400k+ stars on Github. We focus on developing open-source tools and models that push the boundaries of AI while remaining efficient and user-friendly.About the RoleAs a Community Machine Learning Research Engineer, you will be collaborating with science communities while doing impactful machine learning research. You’ll be responsible for :  Build and facilitate non-consortium-based research collaborations with researchers in non-AI scientific fields (e.g., biology, physics, chemistry, quantum, fluid dynamics) to explore innovative applications of ML tools. Co-build ML tools and models for scientific use cases, co-developing solutions and publishing pre-trained models or datasets tailored to these domains. Educate and engage with the scientific community through tutorials, workshops, and open-source contributions to bridge the gap between ML and traditional sciences. Foster strategic partnerships and community research initiatives with academic institutions and organizations to advance interdisciplinary innovation and adoption. The work will likely be pretty varied: in some cases, you might work with industry or academic partners early in the research process. In other cases, you might set up these collaborations at a high level and guide them to the final release. We’re interested in folks who are willing to experiment with different models and figure out how to have the most impact while working with the amazing science machine learning community.About YouYou have done cutting-edge machine learning research and/or engaged and collaborated with the research community, such as Jean-Zay, Alan Turing Institute, PRACE, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Institute for Quantum Computing …You'll enjoy working here if you: Have a generalist Research Engineer with an ability to experiment with different models and figure out how to have the most impact while working with the amazing science machine learning community.
