  "description": "About Anthropic\nAnthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role\nAnthropic Labs is seeking an Engineering Manager to lead and grow our team of software engineers working on early-stage AI capabilities. As the Engineering Manager for Labs, you'll create an environment where engineers can thrive in the inherently uncertain world of 0-1 development, while maintaining clear direction and stability for the team.\nYou'll partner closely with designers, product managers, and research teams to transform emerging AI capabilities into potential products. Success in this role requires exceptional interpersonal intelligence, the ability to facilitate rapid learning cycles, and skill in helping teams navigate the natural ups and downs of early-stage development.\nAbout Anthropic Labs:\nAnthropic Labs serves as an internal accelerator tasked with bridging the gap between research and product development. Our mandate is to identify paradigm-shifting opportunities from research that could ship as products in a 6-12 month timeframe. We embed with research teams to provide product perspective, build prototypes, and pressure test assumptions. Successful projects will transition to Product teams for launch.\nResponsibilities:\n\nLead and coach a high-performing team of software engineers through the complexities of 0-1 development\nPartner effectively with design and product leaders to align on direction and execution\nCreate a balanced environment that encourages both creative exploration and rigorous evaluation\nProvide clear, actionable feedback and support for engineer growth and development\nHelp teams develop structured approaches to testing hypotheses and evaluating results\nFacilitate effective collaboration between Labs engineers and research teams\nDrive adoption of Labs' prototypes and learnings to inform company-wide product strategy and planning\nRepresent the Labs perspective and roadmap in discussions with research, product, and leadership stakeholders\n\nYou may be a good fit if you:\n\nHave 5+ years of engineering management experience leading high-performing teams in ambiguous, early-stage environments\nExcel at creating psychological safety and helping teams navigate uncertainty\nHave strong strategic thinking skills to identify high-potential research breakthroughs and paths to productization\nDemonstrate exceptional interpersonal intelligence and ability to guide teams through rapid pivots\nHave excellent cross-functional leadership skills to build alignment between research, engineering, product and design\nAre skilled at facilitating decision-making rather than imposing solutions\nHave expertise in attracting, mentoring and retaining top talent from diverse backgrounds and skill sets\nHave excellent communication skills to tell the story of Labs' work and impact to leadership and the company\nHave a comprehensive technical understanding across full-stack engineering, ML/AI, data science and modern product development\nCare deeply about responsibly pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities in service of Anthropic's mission\n\nDeadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.The expected salary range for this position is:Annual Salary:$320,000—$560,000 USDLogistics\nLocation-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.\nVisa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\nWe encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.\nHow we're different\nWe believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.\nThe easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.\nCome work with us!\nAnthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",
