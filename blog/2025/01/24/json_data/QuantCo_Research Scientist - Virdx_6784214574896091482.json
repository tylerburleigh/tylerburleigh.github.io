  "description": "Background. Virdx - the virtual diagnostics unit of QuantCo - is making non-invasive, dignified, and actionable tissue characterization for cancer detection and treatment a reality. Starting with prostate cancer - the most frequent and second most deadly cancer in men in the USA - Virdx is changing the paradigm for medical artificial intelligence. Virdx intends to replace the biopsy procedure with an imaging-based alternative that is free of side-effects: An in vivo microscope for virtual biopsy procedures. In doing so, Virdx is solving a broad range of high-profile challenges in the fields of magnetic resonance physics, machine learning, and software engineering.Help us change medicine. Virdx aims to deliver fundamental changes to the way cancer is assessed. In its R&D effort, Virdx builds upon the principle “novel data for novel algorithms”. This means that Virdx is optimizing MRI protocols, with a particular emphasis on diffusion imaging, to power algorithms that can fully replace physical biopsies. Your role. To build the product, you, as a research scientist at Virdx, will work on our diffusion simulation engine, our MRI protocols, and our ground truth pipeline. \nEssential:\n\nAdvanced degree (PhD, PostDoc, or MSc with 3+ years of experience) in physics, applied mathematics, statistics, electrical engineering or a related field Deep theoretical understanding of and practical experience with statistical inference in complex, high-dimensional systems, experience in Bayesian inferencePractical experience with machine learning for probabilistic modeling (eg., density estimation, generative modeling, etc.)Strong coding skills in Python Complete proficiency in English\nDesirable:\n\nHigh-quality publications in relevant fields and/or contribution to open source repositoriesStatistics for PDEs and inverse problemsExperience with Monte-Carlo methods or other sampling methodsExperience with large, real-world data setsWillingness to travel Previous mentorship experience / supervision of other students or small teamsFamiliarity with a modern software development stack (git, containerization, etc.)\nWhat we offer:\n\nJoin an exciting, early-stage, and fast-paced team working on the frontiers of medical research and machine learningWork with an interdisciplinary team of motivated and driven individuals, with a vision to bring meaningful change to an industryGenerous compensation package that includes a base salary, bonus, stock options, and relocation support along with additional location-based benefitsLocationThe team is based in Europe and the US.
