  "description": "About Loop\nLoop is on a mission to unlock profits trapped in the supply chain (https://loop.com/article/unlock-profit-trapped-in-your-supply-chain) and lower costs for consumers. Bad data and inefficient workflows create friction that limits working capital and raises costs for every supply chain stakeholder.\nLoop’s modern audit and pay platform uses our domain-driven AI to harness the complexity of supply chain data and documentation. We improve transportation spend visibility so companies can control their costs and power profit. That is why industry leaders like J.P. Morgan Chase, Great Dane, Emerge, and Loadsmart work with Loop.\nOur investors include J.P. Morgan, Index Ventures, Founders Fund, 8VC, Susa Ventures, Flexport, and 50 industry-leading angel investors. Our team brings subject matter expertise from companies like Uber, Google, Flexport, Meta, Samsara, Intuit, Rakuten, and long-standing industry leaders like C.H. Robinson.\n \nAbout The Role\nLoop is growing its AI team and you’ll have the opportunity to build both AI models and features that directly impact Loop’s business. Loop is positioned to disrupt the incumbent freight audit and pay market, and is one of the companies leading the AI services wave, utilizing AI to automate complex back-office workflows and tasks. You will face and solve many complex technical challenges while you receive guidance and feedback from the team. The range of work here is broad, you can work on everything from training and deploying in-house multimodal LLMs, scaling our inference infrastructure, or building out and shipping AI agent workflows. In doing so, you’ll have the opportunity to define how the AI and broader Loop team will grow. \nWhat you will work on\nOur primary focus has been on document extraction and understanding, where we utilize multimodal LLMs to extract, normalize, and link data together into our domain model. As Loop’s customers rely on Loop to ingest and normalize highly accurate data, we hold ourselves to a high standard to build models with a very high level of accuracy. In tandem, Loop’s machine learning platform requires a high degree of reliability and scalability, and we expect our training and inference volume to scale several orders of magnitude in the coming year. Going forward, Loop will expand its AI capabilities, expanding into other areas such as workflow automation and audit, where we will utilize agents to tackle these problems. \nThis role spans multiple domains:\n\nML modeling – training, evaluating, and deploying models.\nML infrastructure – scaling data infrastructure, training, or inference, improving reliability of ML systems at Loop.\nAI engineering – utilizing and orchestrating API LLM models to solve business problems at Loop.\nBackend engineering – building out atomic tasks, general backend work in the servicing or automation domain.\n\nSome projects you might work on:\n\nScaling up throughput of Loop’s inference engine through continuous batching.\nDeveloping ways to fine-tuning multimodal LLMs to reduce hallucinations.\nBuild out agents that audits freight invoices.\n\nQualifications\n\n1+ years of hands-on experience in deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.)\nSolid understanding of fundamental ML algorithms, especially multimodal LLMs.\nExperience fine-tuning LLMs and deploying them to production or building out agentic systems.\nAbility to ship high-quality code to production.\nExperience in cloud environments (AWS, Google, Azure).\nStrong communication skills and willingness to collaborate in a cross-functional team environment with domain experts.\nKeep up to date with the latest AI research.\nAbility to work in a fast-paced environment.\n\nBonus Points\n\nPrior startup experience.\nEnd-to-end experience building out machine learning models and features.\n\nCompensation\n\nBase pay 130k - 200k\n\nBenefits & Perks\n\nPremium Medical, Dental, and Vision Insurance plans\nInsurance premiums covered 100% for you\nUnlimited PTO\nFireside chats with industry leading keynote speakers\nOff-sites in locales such as Napa and Tahoe\nGenerous professional development budget to feed your curiosity\nPhysical and Mental fitness subsidies for yoga, meditation, gym, or ski memberships",
