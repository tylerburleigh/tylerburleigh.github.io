  "analysis": "The job involves architecting production-level ML workloads, providing technical support, collaborating with product and engineering teams, building data science workloads, and advising on GenAI solutions. The skills required include expertise in ML applications, technical support, collaboration, MLOps, cloud platforms, NLP techniques, and communication skills.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This role focuses on AI research, experimentation, and developing datasets, which doesn't align with the job's focus on production-level ML workloads and customer solutions.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves productionizing AI models and developing data pipelines, which partially aligns with the job's focus on ML workloads and MLOps. However, it lacks the advisory and customer collaboration aspects.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, which aligns with the job's MLOps and cloud platform skills. However, it doesn't cover the advisory and customer-facing responsibilities.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions, collaborating with SMEs, and providing thought leadership, which aligns well with the job's responsibilities of architecting ML workloads, collaborating with teams, and advising on GenAI solutions. The skills required, such as understanding LLM capabilities and communication skills, also match the job's requirements.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which doesn't align with the job's focus on production-level ML workloads and customer solutions.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves building data pipelines and architectures, which doesn't align with the job's focus on ML workloads and customer solutions.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role focuses on product vision and strategy, which doesn't align with the job's technical and advisory focus.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development, which doesn't align with the job's focus on ML workloads and customer solutions.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the \"AI Solution Architect\" role, as both involve designing AI solutions, collaborating with teams, and advising on GenAI solutions.",
