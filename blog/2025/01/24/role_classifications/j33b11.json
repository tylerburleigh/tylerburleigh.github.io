  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on collaborating with product, design, and engineering teams to develop AI bot traits, writing prompts, generating datasets, and managing projects in a fast-paced environment. The skills required include a strong understanding of NLP, psychology, sociology, and prompt engineering, as well as the ability to communicate design concepts and work independently.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option involves investigating AI methodologies, conducting experiments, and developing datasets, which aligns with the job's focus on prompt engineering and dataset creation. The skills required, such as a deep understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering, match the job's requirements.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role focuses on transforming research into scalable solutions and developing data pipelines, which does not align closely with the job's focus on prompt engineering and collaboration with product and design teams.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is centered around deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI systems, which is not relevant to the job's focus on prompt engineering and dataset creation.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which partially aligns with the job's focus on collaboration and prompt engineering. However, it is more focused on high-level solution design rather than hands-on prompt engineering and dataset creation.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role involves statistical analysis and model development, which does not align with the job's focus on prompt engineering and collaboration with product and design teams.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This option focuses on data pipelines and architecture, which is not relevant to the job's focus on prompt engineering and collaboration.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which partially aligns with the job's focus on collaboration and managing projects. However, it lacks the technical focus on prompt engineering and dataset creation.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and does not align with the job's focus on prompt engineering and collaboration with product and design teams.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the \"AI Research Scientist\" option, as both involve prompt engineering, dataset creation, and collaboration with product and design teams.",
