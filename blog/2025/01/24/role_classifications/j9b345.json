  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus heavily on AI technologies, prompt systems, and collaboration with cross-functional teams. The responsibilities include building and optimizing GenAI product features, researching new AI technologies, collaborating with various teams, and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. The skills required include strong analytical and critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and adaptability.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option involves investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which aligns with the job's focus on researching and implementing new AI technologies. However, the job's emphasis on collaboration and system operation is less pronounced in this option.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role focuses on transforming research into scalable solutions and maintaining data pipelines, which partially aligns with the job's focus on building and optimizing AI features. However, the job's emphasis on prompt systems and cross-functional collaboration is not a primary focus here.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is about ensuring reliable deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which does not align well with the job's focus on prompt systems and AI feature development.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and ensuring compliance with data governance, which aligns with the job's focus on enhancing user experience and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. The emphasis on collaboration and prompt architectures also matches well.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which does not align well with the job's focus on prompt systems and AI feature development.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role is about building data pipelines and architectures, which does not align with the job's focus on AI technologies and prompt systems.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which partially aligns with the job's focus on collaboration and user experience. However, the technical focus on AI and prompt systems is not a primary aspect of this option.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications, which partially aligns with the job's focus on building and optimizing AI features. However, the specific focus on prompt systems and AI technologies is not a primary aspect of this option.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the \"AI Solution Architect\" option, as both focus on designing AI solutions, ensuring compliance, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.",
