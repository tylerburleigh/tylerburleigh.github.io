  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on developing an AI-enabled PaaS platform, integrating advanced AI features, and implementing Gen AI solutions with a focus on Agentic Orchestration and Agent Builder frameworks. The skills required include proficiency in Python, Java, and SQL, strong knowledge of AI LLM, deep learning principles, and hands-on experience with ANNs and deep learning frameworks.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which aligns with the job's focus on developing AI solutions. However, the job's emphasis on platform development and integration is not a primary focus here.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, which aligns with the job's focus on developing and integrating AI features. The skills in Python and software engineering practices are relevant, but the job's specific focus on PaaS and Agentic Orchestration is not a primary focus here.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI systems, which is not the primary focus of the job, as the job is more about development and integration of AI features.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with experts, which aligns with the job's focus on developing and integrating AI features. The skills in LLM, AI agents, and orchestration frameworks are highly relevant, making this a strong match.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which is not the primary focus of the job, as the job is more about AI platform development and integration.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role focuses on data pipelines and architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job, as the job is more about AI platform development and integration.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role focuses on product vision and strategy, which is not the primary focus of the job, as the job is more about technical development and integration of AI features.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development, which aligns with the job's focus on developing AI platforms. However, the specific focus on AI features and integration makes the AI Solution Architect a better fit.\n\nThe job's focus on developing an AI-enabled PaaS platform, integrating AI features, and implementing Gen AI solutions aligns most closely with the responsibilities and skills of the AI Solution Architect, particularly in terms of designing AI solutions and collaborating with experts.",
