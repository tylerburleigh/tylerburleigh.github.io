  "analysis": "The job involves working collaboratively in a fast-paced environment, training generative AI models, creating prompts and responses, and fine-tuning AI training prompts. It also includes tasks like data annotation, process improvement, and providing feedback on tools. The skills required include writing, research, evaluating LLM prompts, problem-solving, and learning new technologies.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies, conducting experiments, and developing datasets. The job's focus on training generative AI models and evaluating prompts aligns with this role, but the responsibilities are more research-oriented than the job's practical tasks.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves productionizing AI models and developing data pipelines. The job's focus on training models and working with data specialists is somewhat related, but the engineering focus is not a direct match.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is about deploying and monitoring AI systems, which doesn't align with the job's focus on training models and creating prompts.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs. While the job involves working with AI models, it doesn't focus on solution architecture or high-level design.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role involves data analysis and model development, which is not directly related to the job's focus on training AI models and creating prompts.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role focuses on data pipelines and architecture, which doesn't align with the job's focus on AI model training and prompt creation.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves product vision and strategy, which is not related to the job's focus on AI model training and prompt creation.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development, which doesn't align with the job's focus on AI model training and prompt creation.\n\nThe job's responsibilities and skills align most closely with the **AI Research Scientist** role, as both involve working with generative AI models, creating prompts, and evaluating LLM prompts. However, the job is more practical and hands-on compared to the research-oriented focus of the AI Research Scientist role.",
