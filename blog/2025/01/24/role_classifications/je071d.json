  "analysis": "The job involves designing, building, and enhancing front-end tooling/products for LLM data collection using Angular and similar frameworks, focusing on backend data engineering tasks, implementing robust backend services, overseeing application deployment tasks utilizing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Machine Learning, and CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, and maintaining high-quality code. The skills required include expertise in Angular or similar front-end frameworks, strong foundation in back-end development, experience in building AI products and systems, knowledge of developing data sets for LLMs, proficiency in deployment processes in Azure environments, knowledge of CI/CD practices using Jenkins, high proficiency in Docker, and strong Python programming skills.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and developing datasets, which is not a direct match for the job's focus on front-end and back-end development, deployment, and data engineering.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves transforming research output into scalable AI solutions, productionizing AI models, and developing data pipelines. While there is some overlap in skills like Python and CI/CD, the primary focus on transforming research output does not align with the job's responsibilities.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role involves ensuring reliable deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI systems, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and managing infrastructure for scalable AI deployments. The job's focus on deployment tasks utilizing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Machine Learning, and CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, as well as Docker proficiency, aligns well with this option.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role focuses on designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which does not align with the job's focus on front-end and back-end development and deployment.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role involves statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, which does not align with the job's focus on front-end and back-end development and deployment.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves designing and maintaining data pipelines and architectures, which partially aligns with the job's focus on backend data engineering tasks. However, the job also involves front-end development and deployment tasks, which are not covered by this option.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which does not align with the job's focus on front-end and back-end development and deployment.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves designing, developing, and maintaining software applications, which aligns with the job's focus on front-end and back-end development. However, the job's specific focus on deployment tasks utilizing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Machine Learning, and CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, as well as Docker proficiency, aligns more closely with the MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer role.\n\nThe job's responsibilities and skills align most closely with the MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer option, as both involve deployment, CI/CD, and infrastructure management tasks.",
