  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills provided in the job description align most closely with the role of an AI/ML Engineer (Option 2). Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Responsibilities:**\n   - The job involves brainstorming with cross-functional teams, leading or contributing to large projects, owning features or systems, resolving production issues, mentoring engineers, and improving engineering standards. These responsibilities align well with the AI/ML Engineer's focus on transforming research output into scalable AI solutions, collaborating with research scientists, and maintaining data pipelines.\n\n2. **Skills:**\n   - The job requires experience with machine learning, software engineering, and proficiency in programming languages like Python, which are essential for an AI/ML Engineer. The skills also include experience with ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), building data processing pipelines, and working with generative AI apps, which are relevant to the AI/ML Engineer's role in productionizing AI models and developing data pipelines.\n\n3. **Comparison with Other Options:**\n   - The AI Research Scientist (Option 1) focuses more on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which is less aligned with the job's emphasis on production and engineering.\n   - The MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer (Option 3) is more focused on deployment and infrastructure, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n   - The AI Solution Architect (Option 4) and Product Manager (Option 7) roles are more strategic and design-oriented, which doesn't match the technical and engineering focus of the job.\n   - The Data Scientist (Option 5) and Data Engineer (Option 6) roles are more data-centric, whereas the job has a broader engineering and ML focus.\n   - The Software Engineer (Option 8) role is more general in software development, while the job has a specific focus on machine learning and AI.\n\nTherefore, the job is most similar to the AI/ML Engineer role, as it involves transforming research into scalable solutions, developing data pipelines, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.",
