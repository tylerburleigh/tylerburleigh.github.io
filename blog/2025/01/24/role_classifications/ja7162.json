  "analysis": "The job description provided focuses on building and maintaining full-stack systems, collaborating with product and technical leaders, developing metrics, staying updated with industry trends, participating in code reviews, and contributing to team building. The skills required include a strong background in front-end and back-end technologies, experience with scalable systems, excitement about LLMs, and proficiency in a tech stack that includes TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Apollo GraphQL, and Aurora PostgreSQL.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and model evaluation, which does not align with the full-stack development and system building focus of the job.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is about transforming research into AI solutions, which is not the primary focus of the job described.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on AI system deployment and monitoring, which is not aligned with the full-stack development and system building focus of the job.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating on AI use cases, which is not the primary focus of the job described.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which does not align with the full-stack development and system building focus of the job.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves data pipeline and architecture development, which is not aligned with the full-stack development and system building focus of the job.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role focuses on product vision and strategy, which is not aligned with the full-stack development and system building focus of the job.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This option aligns well with the job description. It involves designing, developing, and maintaining software applications, collaborating with cross-functional teams, writing clean code, participating in system architecture discussions, and improving system performance. The skills required, such as proficiency in programming languages, experience with modern frameworks, and understanding of software design principles, match the job's requirements.\n\nThe job description is most similar to the \"Software Engineer\" option, as both focus on full-stack development, system building, and collaboration with cross-functional teams.",
