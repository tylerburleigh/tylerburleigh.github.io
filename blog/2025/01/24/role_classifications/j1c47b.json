  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus heavily on developing and leading AI solutions, particularly in the realm of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). The role involves working closely with partners and customers to build scalable AI solutions, contributing to AI applications, and acting as a lead AI developer. The skills required include proficiency in Python and C++, expertise in NVIDIA AI platforms, and practical knowledge of Generative AI and LLM development.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which aligns with some aspects of the job, such as contributing to AI applications and solving real-world problems. However, the job's emphasis on leading development and working with partners to build solutions is not a primary focus here.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is about transforming research into scalable solutions, which partially aligns with the job's focus on building scalable AI solutions. However, the job's emphasis on leading development and acting as a technical expert is not the primary focus of an AI/ML Engineer.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI systems, which is not the primary focus of the job described, as it emphasizes development and collaboration with partners.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions leveraging generative models and LLM technologies, which aligns well with the job's focus on building scalable AI solutions and acting as a lead AI developer. The skills required, such as understanding LLM capabilities and providing thought leadership, match the job's requirements.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on statistical analysis and machine learning to derive insights, which does not align with the job's focus on developing AI solutions and working with partners.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role is about designing and maintaining data pipelines, which is not aligned with the job's focus on AI development and solution building.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role focuses on driving product vision and strategy, which does not align with the job's technical and development-focused responsibilities.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications, which partially aligns with the job's focus on development. However, the job's emphasis on AI solutions and acting as a technical expert is not the primary focus here.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the \"AI Solution Architect\" option, as both focus on designing and orchestrating AI solutions using generative models and LLM technologies, and require strong communication and stakeholder management skills.",
