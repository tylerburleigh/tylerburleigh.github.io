  "analysis": "The Job involves research and development of cross-platform AR effect creation tools for an AI Effect Generation system, and collaboration with product managers and cross-functional teams to design and implement new features. The required skills include knowledge of Generative AI and Graphics technologies, ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams, and strong research and development skills in AR effect creation.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which aligns with the research aspect of the Job. However, it is more focused on AI methodologies and less on AR effect creation tools.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is about transforming research into scalable AI solutions, which is not the primary focus of the Job, as the Job is more about developing tools rather than productionizing models.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI systems, which does not align with the Job's focus on AR effect creation tools.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with teams, which partially aligns with the Job's collaborative aspect. However, it is more focused on solution architecture rather than tool development.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role is centered around data analysis and model development, which does not align with the Job's focus on AR effect creation tools.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves building data pipelines, which is not relevant to the Job's focus on AR effect creation tools.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which aligns with the collaborative aspect of the Job. However, it is more focused on product management rather than tool development.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications and collaborating with teams, which aligns with the Job's focus on developing AR effect creation tools and collaboration. The skills required for the Job, such as knowledge of Generative AI and Graphics technologies, and strong research and development skills, are more aligned with a Software Engineer who works on developing tools and features.\n\nThe Job's focus on developing AR effect creation tools and collaboration with cross-functional teams aligns most closely with the responsibilities and skills of a Software Engineer, who is involved in developing software applications and collaborating with teams to deliver solutions.",
