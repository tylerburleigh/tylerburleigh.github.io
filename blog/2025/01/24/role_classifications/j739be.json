  "analysis": "The job involves developing, testing, and scaling LLM prompts, optimizing chatbot experiences, conducting prompt engineering, and using tools like Excel for analysis. It also requires collaboration with product managers and teams across the organization. The skills needed include competency in LLMs, Python or equivalent software development experience, understanding of NLP techniques, and familiarity with platforms like Dialogflow.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This role focuses on AI methodologies and prompt engineering, which aligns with the job's focus on LLM prompts. It also involves conducting experiments and staying current with AI trends, which matches the job's responsibilities of testing and optimizing prompts. The skills required, such as deep understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering, are relevant to the job.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is more about transforming research into scalable solutions and maintaining data pipelines, which doesn't align closely with the job's focus on prompt engineering and chatbot optimization.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, which is not directly related to the job's focus on prompt engineering and chatbot experiences.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and conversational design, which aligns with the job's focus on optimizing chatbot experiences and engaging customers. The skills in LLM capabilities and conversational design are relevant to the job.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which doesn't align closely with the job's focus on prompt engineering and chatbot optimization.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role is about building data pipelines and architectures, which is not directly related to the job's focus on prompt engineering and chatbot experiences.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which aligns with the job's collaboration with product managers. However, it doesn't focus on the technical aspects of prompt engineering and chatbot optimization.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and system architecture, which doesn't align closely with the job's focus on prompt engineering and chatbot optimization.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the **AI Solution Architect** role, as both involve designing conversational experiences and leveraging LLM technologies to optimize user interactions.",
