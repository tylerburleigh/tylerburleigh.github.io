  "analysis": "The Job involves driving product direction, defining features, and building a core stack for PromptQL, which is an AI assistant and data engine. The Skills required include understanding complex systems, software engineering principles, adaptability, ownership, and comfort in a fast-paced environment.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This role focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and staying current with AI research. The Job's focus on product direction and feature definition does not align with the research-centric responsibilities of this option.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, which is not the primary focus of the Job. The Job is more about product management and feature development rather than engineering AI models.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role is about deploying and monitoring AI systems, which does not align with the Job's focus on product direction and feature definition.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is somewhat related to the Job's responsibilities of defining features and building a core stack. However, the Job is more focused on product management rather than solution architecture.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which does not align with the Job's focus on product direction and feature definition.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves building data pipelines and architectures, which is not related to the Job's focus on product management and feature development.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision, defining product requirements, and collaborating with cross-functional teams, which closely aligns with the Job's responsibilities of driving product direction, defining features, and building a core stack. The Skills required for the Job, such as understanding complex systems and adaptability, also align with the skills of a Product Manager.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications, which is related to the Job's responsibility of building a core stack. However, the Job's focus on product direction and feature definition aligns more closely with a Product Manager role.\n\nThe Job's responsibilities and skills align most closely with the Product Manager role, as both involve driving product direction, defining features, and collaborating with teams to deliver impactful solutions.",
