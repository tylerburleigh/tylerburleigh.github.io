  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on developing user interfaces, prototyping, and building scalable solutions, which align closely with the role of a Software Engineer. The responsibilities include developing user interfaces, prototyping, and building scalable solutions, which are typical tasks for a Software Engineer. The skills required, such as proficiency in HTML, CSS, JS, React, Angular, NodeJS, and Flask, as well as experience with design tools like Figma, are also consistent with the skills expected of a Software Engineer. Additionally, the emphasis on writing clean, testable, peer-reviewed code and owning end-to-end feature development aligns with the responsibilities of a Software Engineer, who is expected to write efficient code and participate in system architecture and design discussions.\n\nComparing this with the Options:\n1. AI Research Scientist: Focuses on AI methodologies and experiments, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n2. AI/ML Engineer: Focuses on productionizing AI models, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n3. MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer: Focuses on AI system deployment and monitoring, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n4. AI Solution Architect: Focuses on designing AI solutions, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n5. Data Scientist: Focuses on data analysis and modeling, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n6. Data Engineer: Focuses on data pipelines and architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n7. Product Manager: Focuses on product vision and strategy, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n8. Software Engineer: Focuses on developing and maintaining software applications, which aligns well with the job's responsibilities and skills.\n\nThe job is most similar to the Software Engineer role, as it involves developing user interfaces, writing clean code, and building scalable solutions, which are key aspects of a Software Engineer's responsibilities.",
