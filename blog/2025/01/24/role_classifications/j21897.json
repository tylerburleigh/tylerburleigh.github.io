  "analysis": "The job involves designing, building, and deploying AI-powered solutions, leveraging large language models (LLMs), collaborating with cross-functional teams, developing scalable systems, driving innovation, and mentoring junior engineers. The required skills include proficiency in Python and AI frameworks, experience with LLMs, machine learning model deployment, problem-solving, and communication skills.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies, conducting experiments, and staying current with AI research. While it involves LLMs, the primary focus is on research rather than deploying solutions, which is a key aspect of the job.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This option involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, productionizing AI models, and collaborating with research scientists. The responsibilities and skills align well with the job's focus on deploying AI solutions, leveraging LLMs, and collaborating with teams.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, which is part of the job's responsibilities. However, the job's emphasis on designing AI solutions and leveraging LLMs is more aligned with an AI/ML Engineer.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions, collaborating with SMEs, and ensuring solutions align with business objectives. While it involves LLMs, the focus is more on architecture and less on building and deploying solutions.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. While it involves machine learning, it does not align with the job's focus on deploying AI solutions and leveraging LLMs.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves designing data pipelines and architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which does not align with the technical and AI-focused responsibilities of the job.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications, which is part of the job, but it lacks the specific focus on AI and LLMs.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the AI/ML Engineer role, as both involve deploying AI solutions, leveraging LLMs, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.",
