  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills provided in the job description align most closely with the role of an \"AI/ML Engineer\" (Option 2). The job involves interacting with customers to understand business problems and implementing scalable ML/DL solutions, which aligns with transforming research output into robust, scalable AI solutions. The responsibilities also include collaborating with product managers, designers, engineers, and other stakeholders, which is similar to the AI/ML Engineer's role of collaborating closely with Research Scientists to optimize and refine model implementations.\n\nThe skills required for the job, such as proficiency in Python, experience with PyTorch and TensorFlow, containerization, microservices, and deployment using Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms, align well with the AI/ML Engineer's skills and tools, which include proficiency in Python, experience with API development and integration, and working knowledge of software engineering best practices.\n\nWhile the job also mentions fostering a healthy and inclusive team environment and providing technical guidance, which could align with some aspects of the \"AI Solution Architect\" (Option 4) or \"Product Manager\" (Option 7), the primary focus on scalable ML/DL solutions and the technical skills required make the AI/ML Engineer the best fit.\n\nOther options like \"AI Research Scientist\" (Option 1), \"MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer\" (Option 3), \"Data Scientist\" (Option 5), \"Data Engineer\" (Option 6), and \"Software Engineer\" (Option 8) do not align as closely with the job's primary focus on deploying scalable ML/DL solutions and the specific technical skills listed.",
