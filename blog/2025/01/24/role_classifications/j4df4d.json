  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus heavily on designing and implementing AI workflows, cloud-native applications, and collaborating with engineering and IT teams to enhance automation and integration. The job also emphasizes knowledge of cloud-based ML architecture, MLOps systems, and rapid prototyping. The skills required include cloud-based ML architecture, NLP tools, software engineering, statistical modeling, and experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and staying current with AI research. While there is some overlap in AI and ML, the job's focus on cloud-native applications and MLOps systems is not aligned with this option.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This option involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, productionizing AI models, and developing data pipelines. The job's focus on cloud-native applications and MLOps systems aligns well with this option, as it involves deploying and maintaining applications and collaborating with engineering teams.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and managing infrastructure. The job's emphasis on cloud-native applications, MLOps systems, and automation aligns well with this option.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This option involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs. The job's focus on cloud-native applications and MLOps systems does not align with this option.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This option focuses on statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. While there is some overlap in machine learning, the job's focus on cloud-native applications and MLOps systems is not aligned with this option.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This option involves designing data pipelines and architectures. The job's focus on cloud-native applications and MLOps systems does not align with this option.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This option involves driving product vision and strategy. The job's focus on cloud-native applications and MLOps systems does not align with this option.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This option involves designing and maintaining software applications. While there is some overlap in software engineering skills, the job's focus on cloud-native applications and MLOps systems is more aligned with AI/ML Engineer and MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer roles.\n\nThe job is a good fit with both the AI/ML Engineer and MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer options. However, the emphasis on cloud-native applications, MLOps systems, and automation suggests a stronger alignment with the MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer role.",
