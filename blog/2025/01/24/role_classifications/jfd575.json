  "analysis": "The job involves developing machine learning models, particularly using NLP and transformer-based models, and creating LLM-based solutions. It requires collaboration with cross-functional teams and working in an agile environment. The skills required include experience with LLMs, data manipulation, and strong communication skills.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which aligns with the job's focus on developing ML models. However, the job emphasizes practical application and collaboration, which is more aligned with engineering roles.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This option involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, which aligns well with the job's focus on developing ML models and collaborating with engineering teams. The skills required, such as proficiency in Python and API development, are relevant to the job.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about model development and collaboration.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is somewhat related to the job's responsibilities. However, the job is more focused on model development rather than high-level solution architecture.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role involves data analysis and model development, which is related to the job. However, the job's focus on LLMs and collaboration with engineering teams aligns more with an AI/ML Engineer role.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role focuses on data pipelines and architecture, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about model development and collaboration.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more technical and focused on model development.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development, which is related to the job. However, the job's focus on ML models and LLMs aligns more with an AI/ML Engineer role.\n\nThe job's responsibilities and skills align most closely with the AI/ML Engineer role, as it involves developing ML models, collaborating with engineering teams, and working in an agile environment.",
