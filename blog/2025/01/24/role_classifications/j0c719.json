  "analysis": "The job involves conducting research and development on AI/ML algorithms for robotic solutions, integrating AI models into real-world applications, and publishing research findings. The skills required include understanding modern ML architectures, experience with deep learning frameworks, designing research agendas, and knowledge of robotics software.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which aligns with the job's research responsibilities. The skills required, such as understanding LLMs and prompt engineering, are somewhat related but not directly aligned with the job's focus on robotics and multimodal modeling.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves transforming research into scalable solutions, which partially aligns with the job's integration of AI models into applications. However, the primary focus on productionizing models and developing data pipelines is not the main emphasis of the job.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option focuses on deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which is not directly related to the job's research and development focus.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is not directly related to the job's research and development focus.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on statistical analysis and model development, which is not directly aligned with the job's emphasis on AI/ML research for robotics.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves building data pipelines and architectures, which is not directly related to the job's research and development focus.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which is not directly related to the job's research and development focus.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and maintenance, which is not directly related to the job's research and development focus.\n\nThe job's responsibilities and skills are most closely aligned with the \"AI Research Scientist\" option, as both involve conducting research and developing AI methodologies, although the specific focus on robotics is not explicitly mentioned in the option.",
