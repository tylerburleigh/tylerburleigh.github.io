  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus heavily on AI and ML methodologies, data analysis, and working with business partners to provide data solutions. The responsibilities include growing FI Investment sales, generating leads, setting strategies, and implementing AI and ML techniques. The skills required include strong problem-solving, experience with scripting languages like Python, data analysis, ETL tools, distributed computing, cloud computing, and statistical models.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on cutting-edge AI methodologies, experiments, and staying current with AI research. While the job involves AI and ML, it is more business-oriented and less focused on research and experimentation.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, productionizing models, and developing data pipelines. The job's focus on implementing AI and ML techniques and working with data solutions aligns well with this option.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role is about deploying and monitoring AI systems, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role involves statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. The job's focus on data analysis and ML techniques aligns well with this option.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves building data pipelines and architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the roles of AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist, as both involve working with AI/ML techniques and data analysis. However, the emphasis on implementing AI and ML techniques to grow the business and working closely with business partners suggests a stronger alignment with the AI/ML Engineer role, which focuses on transforming research into scalable solutions and developing data pipelines.",
