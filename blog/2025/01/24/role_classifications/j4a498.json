  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on designing, running, and analyzing scientific experiments related to large language models and their application to cybersecurity tasks. It also involves leading technical design discussions, collaborating with engineers, and working with external partners to develop evaluations. The skills required include strong software engineering or AI/ML research experience, interest or experience in offensive cybersecurity, ability to write clean code in Python, and familiarity with large language models.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option involves conducting experiments to evaluate AI approaches, collaborating with engineers, and staying current with AI research. The skills required include a deep understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering, which aligns with the job's focus on large language models. This option is a good fit as it involves similar responsibilities and skills.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role focuses on transforming research output into scalable AI solutions, which is not the primary focus of the job. The skills required are more about productionizing models and developing data pipelines, which do not align closely with the job's research and experimentation focus.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role is about ensuring reliable deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which does not align with the job's focus on research and experimentation with large language models.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is not the primary focus of the job. The skills required are more about solution design and stakeholder management, which do not align closely with the job's research focus.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role involves statistical analysis and developing predictive models, which is not the primary focus of the job. The skills required are more about data analysis and visualization, which do not align closely with the job's focus on large language models and cybersecurity.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves designing data pipelines and architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job. The skills required are more about data processing and infrastructure, which do not align closely with the job's research focus.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which is not the primary focus of the job. The skills required are more about product management and stakeholder communication, which do not align closely with the job's research focus.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications, which is not the primary focus of the job. The skills required are more about software development and system architecture, which do not align closely with the job's research focus.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the responsibilities and skills of the AI Research Scientist, as both involve conducting experiments, collaborating with engineers, and focusing on large language models.",
