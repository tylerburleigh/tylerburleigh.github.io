  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on building deep learning models, analyzing large datasets, and engaging with vendors for data understanding. The skills required include experience with deep learning frameworks, coding in Python and SQL, and working with large datasets. \n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and staying current with AI research. While there is some overlap in deep learning and model evaluation, the primary focus on generative models and AI research does not align closely with the job's focus on data processing and management.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves transforming research into scalable solutions and developing data pipelines. The job's focus on building models and analyzing datasets aligns somewhat with this role, but the emphasis on productionizing models and API development is not a direct match.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is about deploying and monitoring AI systems, which does not align with the job's focus on model building and data analysis.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is not directly related to the job's focus on deep learning model development and data analysis.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role involves data analysis, model development, and collaboration with teams, which aligns well with the job's responsibilities of analyzing datasets, generating statistics, and proposing data applications. The skills in Python, SQL, and deep learning frameworks also match well.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role focuses on data pipelines and architecture, which is not the primary focus of the job, although there is some overlap in data management.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role is about product vision and strategy, which does not align with the technical and analytical focus of the job.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and system design, which does not align with the job's focus on deep learning and data analysis.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the \"Data Scientist\" option, as both involve data analysis, model development, and the use of deep learning frameworks.",
