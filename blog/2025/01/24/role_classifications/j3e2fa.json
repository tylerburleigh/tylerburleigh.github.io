  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on supporting product development in AI and machine learning, contributing to software engineering, interfacing with stakeholders, driving model development, collaborating with cross-functional teams, mentoring, translating business problems, fostering innovation, and communicating effectively. The skills required include proficiency in Python, software engineering, machine learning model development, managing uncertainty, strong communication, API development, familiarity with NLP/CV libraries, cloud solutions, and experience in agile environments.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on cutting-edge AI methodologies, experiments, and staying current with AI research. The job's focus on product development, software engineering, and stakeholder interaction does not align well with the research-centric responsibilities of this option.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This option involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, productionizing models, and developing data pipelines. The job's focus on product development, model lifecycle management, and software engineering aligns well with this option, especially with the emphasis on deploying and integrating models into production.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI systems, with a strong DevOps background. While the job involves some aspects of deployment and monitoring, its broader focus on product development and stakeholder interaction makes it less aligned with this option.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This option involves designing AI solutions, collaborating with SMEs, and providing thought leadership. The job's focus on product development and model lifecycle management does not align well with the architectural and strategic focus of this option.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This option focuses on statistical analysis, model development, and data visualization. While the job involves model development, its broader focus on product development and software engineering makes it less aligned with this option.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This option involves designing data pipelines and architectures. The job's focus on product development, model lifecycle management, and software engineering does not align well with the data-centric responsibilities of this option.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This option involves driving product vision and strategy, conducting research, and collaborating with teams. While the job involves stakeholder interaction and product development, its technical focus on model development and software engineering makes it less aligned with this option.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This option involves designing and maintaining software applications, collaborating with teams, and writing code. The job's focus on software engineering, model development, and product development aligns well with this option, especially with the emphasis on developing new features and models.\n\nThe job is most similar to the AI/ML Engineer option, as it involves supporting product development, model lifecycle management, and software engineering, which aligns with transforming research into scalable AI solutions and productionizing models.",
