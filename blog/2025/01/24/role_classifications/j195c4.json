  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus heavily on cybersecurity, threat analysis, and leveraging AI-driven techniques, including LLMs and agentic systems. The responsibilities include analyzing complex issues, creating solutions to mitigate security issues, collaborating with research scientists, and prototyping exploitation methods using AI techniques. The skills required include proficiency in software development, cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and the ability to leverage AI-driven techniques.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and model evaluation, which aligns with the job's focus on leveraging AI-driven techniques. However, it lacks the cybersecurity and threat analysis aspect.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is about transforming research into scalable solutions, which doesn't align with the job's focus on security and threat analysis.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which doesn't match the job's focus on security and threat analysis.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and ensuring compliance with security considerations, which partially aligns with the job's focus on security and AI techniques. However, it lacks the specific focus on threat analysis and cybersecurity.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which doesn't align with the job's focus on security and AI-driven threat analysis.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role is about data pipelines and architecture, which doesn't match the job's focus on security and AI-driven threat analysis.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role focuses on product vision and strategy, which doesn't align with the job's focus on security and AI-driven threat analysis.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and system architecture, which doesn't align with the job's focus on security and AI-driven threat analysis.\n\nNone of the options fully align with the job's focus on cybersecurity, threat analysis, and leveraging AI-driven techniques for security purposes. The closest match is the AI Solution Architect, but it still lacks the specific focus on threat analysis and cybersecurity.",
