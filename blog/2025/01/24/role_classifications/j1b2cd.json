  "analysis": "The job involves research and development of cross-platform AR effect creation tools for TikTok's AI Effect Generation system, working closely with PM and cross-functional teams, and driving the design of future directions for these tools. The skills required include expertise in Generative AI and Graphics technologies, collaboration with cross-functional teams, and strong R skills in AR effect creation tools.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and staying current with AI research. While it involves generative AI, it is more research-oriented and less about tool development or cross-functional collaboration, which are key aspects of the job.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is about transforming research into scalable AI solutions, productionizing models, and developing data pipelines. It doesn't align well with the job's focus on AR effect creation tools and design direction.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is about deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, which doesn't match the job's focus on AR effect creation and tool development.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is somewhat related to the job's responsibilities. However, it is more about high-level solution architecture rather than hands-on tool development and design.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis, model development, and experimentation, which doesn't align with the job's focus on AR effect creation tools and generative AI.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role is about data pipelines and architecture, which is not relevant to the job's focus on AR effect creation and generative AI.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which aligns with some aspects of the job, such as working with PM and cross-functional teams. However, it lacks the technical focus on AR effect creation tools and generative AI expertise.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and collaboration with cross-functional teams, which aligns with the job's responsibilities. However, it lacks the specific focus on AR effect creation tools and generative AI expertise.\n\nThe job's focus on AR effect creation tools, generative AI, and collaboration with cross-functional teams aligns most closely with the responsibilities and skills of an AI Solution Architect, as it involves designing impactful experiences and solutions, which can include AR effects. However, the job is more hands-on with tool development, which is not the primary focus of the AI Solution Architect role. Despite this, the AI Solution Architect is the closest match among the options provided.",
