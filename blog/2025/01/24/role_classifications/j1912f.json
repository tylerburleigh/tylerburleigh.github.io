  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on developing and productionizing machine learning solutions, particularly in AI-driven applications, backend services, and API integration. The job also emphasizes working across the ML model lifecycle, including training, validation, and deployment, as well as ensuring security and compliance with healthcare data.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about development and productionizing solutions rather than research.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This option aligns well with the job's focus on transforming research into scalable AI solutions, productionizing AI models, and developing data pipelines. The skills required, such as proficiency in Python and experience with API development, match the job description.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI systems, which is part of the job but not its primary focus. The job is more about developing and integrating AI solutions rather than infrastructure management.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This option involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more technical and hands-on with development and integration.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This option focuses on data analysis and model development, which is part of the job, but the job is more focused on the development and integration of AI solutions rather than data analysis.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This option focuses on data pipelines and architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about developing AI-driven applications and services.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This option focuses on product vision and strategy, which is not relevant to the job's technical and development focus.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This option involves software development and maintenance, which is part of the job, but the job is more specialized in AI and ML solutions.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the AI/ML Engineer role, as it involves developing and productionizing AI solutions, working with APIs, and ensuring performance and reliability, which are key aspects of the AI/ML Engineer responsibilities.",
