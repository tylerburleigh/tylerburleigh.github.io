  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on cloud solutions, customer success, and technical workshops, with a strong emphasis on cloud services and cloud-native technologies. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This role focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and model evaluation, which doesn't align with the cloud and customer success focus of the job.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is about transforming AI research into scalable solutions, which is not directly related to the cloud solutions and customer success aspects of the job.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role involves deploying and monitoring AI systems, with a focus on infrastructure and DevOps, which partially aligns with the cloud services aspect but not with customer success or workshops.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which doesn't match the cloud solutions and customer success focus of the job.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which doesn't align with the cloud solutions and customer success focus of the job.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves building data pipelines and architectures, which is not directly related to the cloud solutions and customer success aspects of the job.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which doesn't align with the technical cloud solutions and customer success focus of the job.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and system architecture, which partially aligns with the cloud services aspect but not with customer success or workshops.\n\nNone of the options fully align with the job's focus on building cloud solutions, delivering workshops, and improving customer success. The closest match in terms of cloud services and technical skills might be the MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer, but it lacks the customer success and workshop delivery aspects. Therefore, none of the options are a perfect fit.",
