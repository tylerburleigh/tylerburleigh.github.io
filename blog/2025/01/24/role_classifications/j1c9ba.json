  "analysis": "The Job responsibilities and skills focus on research, design, and implementation of algorithms, training large language models (LLMs), and driving applied research for product development. The skills required include deep learning, neural networks, machine learning libraries like PyTorch, scripting languages such as Python, and problem-solving abilities.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option aligns well with the job as it involves investigating AI methodologies, conducting experiments, and staying current with AI research. The skills required, such as a deep understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering, match the job's focus on LLMs and deep learning.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role focuses on transforming research into scalable solutions, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more research-oriented rather than productionizing models.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role is about deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which does not align with the research and development focus of the job.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is more about solution design rather than research and development of LLMs.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis and model development, which is not the primary focus of the job that emphasizes research and development of LLMs.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role is about building data pipelines and architectures, which does not align with the research and development focus of the job.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role is about driving product vision and strategy, which is not aligned with the research and development focus of the job.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role focuses on software development and maintenance, which is not aligned with the research and development focus of the job.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the \"AI Research Scientist\" option, as both focus on research, experimentation, and development of AI models, particularly LLMs.",
