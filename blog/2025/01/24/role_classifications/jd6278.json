  "analysis": "The Job Responsibilities and Skills focus on building infrastructure for research, conducting experiments, implementing open-source software, collaborating with team members, mentoring, and contributing to scientific papers. The Skills emphasize strong software engineering skills, experience with system building or deep learning frameworks, contributions to open-source libraries, and a passion for AI.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies, conducting experiments, and staying current with AI research. While there is some overlap in conducting experiments and contributing to research, the primary focus on AI methodologies and datasets does not align closely with the job's emphasis on infrastructure and software engineering.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, productionizing models, and collaborating with research scientists. The job's focus on building infrastructure and conducting experiments aligns somewhat with this role, but the emphasis on productionizing models and data pipelines is not a perfect match.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option focuses on deploying, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and managing infrastructure. The job's emphasis on building infrastructure and software engineering skills aligns well with this role, making it a strong fit.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs. The job's focus on research and software engineering does not align with the solution design and business alignment focus of this role.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on data analysis, model development, and presenting findings. The job's emphasis on infrastructure and software engineering does not align with the data-centric focus of this role.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves designing data pipelines and architectures. While there is some overlap in software engineering skills, the job's focus on research and experiments does not align with the data pipeline focus of this role.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy. The job's focus on research and software engineering does not align with the product management focus of this role.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves designing and maintaining software applications. The job's emphasis on software engineering skills and building infrastructure aligns well with this role, making it a potential fit.\n\nThe job's focus on building infrastructure, conducting experiments, and software engineering skills aligns most closely with the MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer role, which emphasizes infrastructure management and software engineering.",
