  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus heavily on implementing and integrating AI/ML models, collaborating with engineers and data scientists, and contributing to both frontend and backend development. The skills required include proficiency in multiple programming languages, experience with AI/ML libraries, and knowledge of software development methodologies.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about implementation and integration rather than research.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This option aligns well with the job as it focuses on transforming research output into scalable AI solutions, productionizing AI models, and collaborating with research scientists. The skills required, such as proficiency in programming languages and software engineering best practices, match well with the job description.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is more about ensuring reliable deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which is a part of the job but not the primary focus. The job is more about development and integration rather than infrastructure management.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This option focuses on designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about hands-on development and integration.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This option focuses on data analysis and model development, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about implementing and integrating AI/ML models.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This option focuses on designing and maintaining data pipelines, which is a part of the job but not the primary focus. The job is more about AI/ML model integration and development.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This option focuses on product vision and strategy, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more technical and development-oriented.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This option aligns with the job in terms of writing clean, efficient code and collaborating with cross-functional teams. However, the job has a stronger focus on AI/ML integration, which is more aligned with the AI/ML Engineer role.\n\nThe job description is most similar to the AI/ML Engineer role, as it involves implementing and integrating AI/ML models, collaborating with engineers, and writing maintainable code, which are key responsibilities of an AI/ML Engineer.",
