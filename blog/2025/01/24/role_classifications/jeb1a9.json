Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Responsibilities**:\n   - The job involves strategizing with sales teams, building demos, presenting solutions, leading technical scoping sessions, and becoming a trusted advisor for clients. These tasks are similar to the responsibilities of an AI Solution Architect, which include collaborating with SMEs, assessing feasibility, developing technical proposals, and providing thought leadership.\n   - The job also requires working closely with various teams (Implementation, Engineering, Product), which aligns with the AI Solution Architect's responsibility to facilitate cross-functional collaboration.\n\n2. **Skills**:\n   - The job requires experience with Python, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, and bash script, as well as working with APIs, which are technical skills that an AI Solution Architect might possess, although not explicitly listed in the option.\n   - The job also requires familiarity with NLP concepts and technologies, which aligns with the AI Solution Architect's understanding of LLM capabilities and prompt engineering principles.\n   - Excellent communication skills and the ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences are crucial for both the job and the AI Solution Architect role.\n\nThe other options, such as AI Research Scientist, AI/ML Engineer, MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Product Manager, and Software Engineer, do not align as closely with the job's focus on client interaction, solution architecture, and cross-functional collaboration.\n\nTherefore, the job is a good fit with the AI Solution Architect role.",
