  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills provided in the job description align most closely with the role of a Software Engineer (Option 8). The responsibilities include building new components, developing high-quality code, making design decisions, working in a hybrid engineering model, and contributing to all phases of the SDLC, which are typical tasks for a Software Engineer. The skills required, such as proficiency in frontend technologies, knowledge of web technologies, experience with front-end frameworks, and strong object-oriented programming skills, are also consistent with the skills expected of a Software Engineer. Additionally, the job mentions experience with version control systems, agile development methodologies, and CI/CD tools, which are common in software engineering roles. While there are some mentions of AI/ML technologies and advanced AI methodologies, the primary focus of the job seems to be on software development rather than AI research or engineering, making Option 8 the best fit.",
