  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus heavily on developing sophisticated search and knowledge graph solutions, optimizing search and retrieval solutions, and collaborating with various teams to deliver scalable AI-driven solutions. The skills required include experience with search optimization, knowledge graphs, vector databases, NLP, and programming in Python and ML frameworks.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on AI methodologies, generative models, and LLMs, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about search and knowledge graph solutions rather than AI research.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is about transforming research into scalable AI solutions, which partially aligns with the job's focus on building and optimizing search solutions. However, the job's emphasis on search and knowledge graphs is not a primary focus here.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about developing search and knowledge graph solutions.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with teams, which aligns with the job's collaborative aspect. However, the focus on generative models and LLMs is not the primary focus of the job.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on statistical analysis and machine learning, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about search and knowledge graph solutions.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role focuses on data pipelines and architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about search and knowledge graph solutions.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role focuses on product vision and strategy, which is not the primary focus of the job. The job is more about technical development of search and knowledge graph solutions.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications, which partially aligns with the job's focus on building solutions. However, the job's emphasis on search and knowledge graphs is not a primary focus here.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the job's focus on search optimization, knowledge graphs, and innovative retrieval techniques. The job seems to require a specialized role that is not fully captured by any of the given options.",
