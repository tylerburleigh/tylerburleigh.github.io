  "analysis": "The Job responsibilities and skills focus on building large-scale distributed systems, ML infrastructure, and data processing pipelines, as well as implementing LLM models in production. This aligns closely with the responsibilities and skills of an AI/ML Engineer (Option 2) and MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer (Option 3).\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist (Option 1):** The primary focus is on research and experimentation with AI methodologies, which does not align with the job's focus on building and implementing systems.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer (Option 2):** This option involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, developing data pipelines, and collaborating with scientists, which matches the job's focus on building ML infrastructure and implementing models in production.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer (Option 3):** This role focuses on deploying, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, which is relevant to the job's focus on building and operating distributed systems and ML infrastructure.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect (Option 4):** This role is more about designing AI solutions and collaborating on high-level architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job.\n\n5. **Data Scientist (Option 5):** The focus here is on data analysis and model development, which does not align with the job's focus on system building and implementation.\n\n6. **Data Engineer (Option 6):** While this role involves building data pipelines, it is more focused on data architecture rather than ML infrastructure and model implementation.\n\n7. **Product Manager (Option 7):** This role is about driving product vision and strategy, which does not align with the technical and engineering focus of the job.\n\n8. **Software Engineer (Option 8):** This role involves software development and system design, which partially aligns with the job's focus on building systems but lacks the specific focus on ML infrastructure and LLM models.\n\nBetween Options 2 and 3, the AI/ML Engineer (Option 2) is the best fit as it directly involves building ML infrastructure and implementing models, which are key aspects of the job's responsibilities.",
