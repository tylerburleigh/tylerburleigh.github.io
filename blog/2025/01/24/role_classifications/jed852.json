  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus on building low-code/no-code GenAI Platform tools using ServiceNow Platform capabilities, writing high-quality code, balancing business objectives with technical scalability, and mentoring other engineers. The skills required include proficiency in Java or a similar language, experience with modern UI frameworks, and strong analytical and design skills.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option focuses on AI methodologies, experiments, and model evaluation, which does not align with the job's focus on software engineering and platform tools.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role is about transforming research into scalable AI solutions, which is not the primary focus of the job, as it emphasizes software development and platform tools.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is centered on deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, which does not match the job's focus on software engineering and platform development.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating on generative AI use cases, which is not directly related to the job's focus on software engineering and platform tools.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This option focuses on data analysis and model development, which is not aligned with the job's emphasis on software engineering and platform tools.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role is about building data pipelines and architectures, which does not match the job's focus on software engineering and platform tools.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This option involves driving product vision and strategy, which is not aligned with the job's focus on software engineering and platform tools.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves designing, developing, and maintaining software applications, which aligns well with the job's responsibilities of building platform tools, writing high-quality code, and collaborating with product owners. The skills required, such as proficiency in programming languages and experience with modern frameworks, also match the job's requirements.\n\nThe job is most similar to the \"Software Engineer\" option, as both focus on software development, writing clean and scalable code, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.",
