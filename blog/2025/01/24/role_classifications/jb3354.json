  "analysis": "The job involves building AI agents to gather data and provide insights on potential financial crimes, working closely with product teams, defining AI architectures, and mentoring engineers. The skills required include machine learning, software architecture, prompt engineering, and programming languages like Python and GoLang.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This role focuses on investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which aligns with the job's focus on exploring research papers and prototyping techniques. However, the job's emphasis on building AI agents and mentoring engineers is not a primary focus for a research scientist.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role involves transforming research into scalable AI solutions, which aligns with the job's focus on building AI agents and integrating them into workflows. The skills in programming languages and software engineering practices also match well.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This role focuses on deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which is not the primary focus of the job described.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which aligns with the job's focus on defining AI architectures and enhancing customer productivity. The skills in LLMs and prompt engineering also match well.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on statistical analysis and model development, which is not the primary focus of the job described.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves building data pipelines and architectures, which is not the primary focus of the job described.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which is not the primary focus of the job described.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications, which is not the primary focus of the job described.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the roles of AI/ML Engineer and AI Solution Architect due to its focus on building AI agents, defining architectures, and mentoring engineers. However, the emphasis on building AI agents and integrating them into workflows suggests a stronger alignment with the AI/ML Engineer role.",
