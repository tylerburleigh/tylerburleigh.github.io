  "analysis": "The Job responsibilities and skills focus on cutting-edge computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), multi-modality, large language models (LLM), and generative modeling. The responsibilities include conducting development and research, following state-of-the-art progress, and managing life-cycle model development. The skills required are expertise in CV and NLP, proficiency in multi-modality and LLM, experience with generative modeling, and skills in model training, deployment, and maintenance.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option aligns well with the job as it involves investigating and adapting cutting-edge AI methodologies, conducting experiments, and staying current with AI research. The skills required, such as a deep understanding of LLMs and generative models, match the job's focus on CV, NLP, and generative modeling.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role focuses on transforming research output into scalable AI solutions and collaborating with research scientists. While it involves model deployment and maintenance, it is more about productionizing models rather than conducting research and development.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is centered around deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI systems, which is not the primary focus of the job described.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs, which is more about solution design and architecture rather than direct research and development in CV, NLP, and generative modeling.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, which does not align with the specific focus on CV, NLP, and generative modeling.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role is about designing and maintaining data pipelines, which is not relevant to the job's focus on CV, NLP, and generative modeling.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role is about driving product vision and strategy, which does not align with the research and development focus of the job.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and maintenance, which is not directly related to the research and development focus of the job.\n\nThe most relevant option is the AI Research Scientist, as it closely matches the job's focus on cutting-edge research in CV, NLP, and generative modeling, as well as the skills required.",
