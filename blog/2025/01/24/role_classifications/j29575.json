  "analysis": "The Job's Responsibilities and Skills focus on building and innovating components of the perception stack, collaborating on multimodal models, and advancing deep learning innovations. The Skills emphasize fast-paced execution, experimentation, and working with large-scale models.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option involves conducting experiments, collaborating with engineers, and staying current with AI research. The Job's focus on advancing deep learning and working on multimodal models aligns well with the responsibilities and skills of an AI Research Scientist, particularly in conducting experiments and driving innovations.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role focuses on productionizing AI models and developing data pipelines. While there is some overlap in collaboration, the Job's emphasis on research and innovation is more aligned with the AI Research Scientist role.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is centered on deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems. The Job's focus on perception stack innovation and multimodal models does not align with the infrastructure and deployment focus of this role.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and collaborating with SMEs. The Job's focus on perception stack and multimodal models is more technical and research-oriented, which does not align with the solution design and architecture focus of this role.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role involves data analysis, model development, and experimentation. While there is some overlap in experimentation, the Job's focus on perception stack and multimodal models aligns more with AI research than data science.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role focuses on data pipelines and architecture. The Job's focus on perception stack and multimodal models does not align with the data engineering focus.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves product vision and strategy. The Job's focus on technical innovation and research does not align with the product management focus.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves software development and maintenance. The Job's focus on perception stack and multimodal models is more aligned with research and innovation than software engineering.\n\nThe Job's Responsibilities and Skills align most closely with the AI Research Scientist role, given the emphasis on experimentation, innovation, and collaboration on multimodal models.",
