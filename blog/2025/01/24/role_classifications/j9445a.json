  "analysis": "The Job responsibilities and skills focus on prompt engineering, AI-driven solutions, and collaboration with product teams. The key skills include proficiency in Python, familiarity with NLP and machine learning concepts, and strong analytical and problem-solving skills.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option involves cutting-edge AI methodologies and prompt engineering, which aligns with the job's focus on prompt design and AI solutions. The responsibilities of conducting experiments and staying updated on AI trends also match the job's requirements. The skills required, such as a deep understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering, are relevant to the job.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role focuses on transforming research into scalable AI solutions, which is somewhat related to the job's collaboration with product teams for AI-driven solutions. However, the primary focus on productionizing models and maintaining data pipelines is less aligned with the job's emphasis on prompt engineering.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is centered around deployment, scaling, and monitoring AI systems, which does not align with the job's focus on prompt engineering and AI solution development.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions using LLM technologies, which is relevant to the job's focus on developing AI-driven solutions. The responsibilities of collaborating with teams and providing thought leadership on model interaction strategies align with the job's requirements. The skills in LLM capabilities and prompt engineering are also relevant.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This role focuses on statistical analysis and machine learning for insights, which is not directly aligned with the job's focus on prompt engineering and AI-driven solutions.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This option is about building data pipelines and architectures, which is not relevant to the job's focus on prompt engineering and AI solutions.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This role involves driving product vision and strategy, which is not directly related to the job's focus on prompt engineering and AI solutions.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role focuses on software development, which is not aligned with the job's emphasis on prompt engineering and AI-driven solutions.\n\nThe most relevant options are \"AI Research Scientist\" and \"AI Solution Architect,\" as both involve prompt engineering and AI solutions. However, the \"AI Research Scientist\" option is more closely aligned with the job's responsibilities and skills, particularly in terms of prompt design, AI trends, and model evaluation.",
