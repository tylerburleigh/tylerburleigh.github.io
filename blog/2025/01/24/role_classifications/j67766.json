  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills focus heavily on AI technologies, collaboration with cross-functional teams, and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. The role involves building and optimizing AI product features, conducting system tests, and staying updated with AI advancements. The skills required include strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, experience in cross-functional collaboration, and excellent communication skills.\n\n1. **AI Research Scientist**: This option involves investigating AI methodologies and conducting experiments, which aligns with the job's focus on researching and implementing new AI technologies. However, the job's emphasis on collaboration and system operation is less pronounced in this option.\n\n2. **AI/ML Engineer**: This role focuses on transforming research into scalable solutions and maintaining data pipelines, which partially aligns with the job's responsibilities of optimizing AI models and collaborating with engineers. However, the job's emphasis on prompt system operation and compliance is not a primary focus here.\n\n3. **MLOps / AI Infrastructure Engineer**: This option is about ensuring reliable deployment and monitoring of AI systems, which does not align well with the job's focus on building and optimizing AI product features and prompt systems.\n\n4. **AI Solution Architect**: This role involves designing AI solutions and ensuring compliance with data governance, which aligns with the job's responsibilities of enhancing user experience and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. The skills required, such as understanding LLM capabilities and stakeholder management, also match the job's requirements.\n\n5. **Data Scientist**: This option focuses on data analysis and model development, which does not align well with the job's focus on AI product features and prompt systems.\n\n6. **Data Engineer**: This role involves building data pipelines and ensuring data quality, which is not directly related to the job's focus on AI product features and prompt systems.\n\n7. **Product Manager**: This option involves driving product vision and strategy, which partially aligns with the job's focus on enhancing user experience and collaborating with cross-functional teams. However, the technical aspects of AI model optimization and compliance are not a primary focus here.\n\n8. **Software Engineer**: This role involves developing software applications and collaborating with teams, which partially aligns with the job's focus on building AI product features. However, the specific focus on AI technologies and compliance is not a primary focus here.\n\nThe job aligns most closely with the \"AI Solution Architect\" option, as both involve designing AI solutions, ensuring compliance, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.",
