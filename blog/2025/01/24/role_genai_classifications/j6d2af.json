The skills section mentions expertise in AI and machine learning, as well as experience with cloud AI/ML solutions and tools such as AWS Sagemaker, Comprehend, and GCP AutoML. These tools are often used for machine learning tasks, which can include working with language models. However, there is no explicit mention of Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The focus seems to be more on general AI/ML and cloud-based solutions rather than specifically on GenAI or LLMs.",
