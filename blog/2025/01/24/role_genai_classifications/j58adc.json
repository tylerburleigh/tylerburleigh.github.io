  "analysis": "The job described involves teaching courses in computational linguistics, advising student thesis projects, and organizing activities related to computational linguistics. The skills required include proficiency in computational methods and quantitative analysis in linguistics, as well as the ability to teach and mentor students. While computational linguistics can involve working with language models, the job description does not explicitly mention Generative AI or Large Language Models (LLMs). The focus seems to be on teaching and advising within the field of computational linguistics, which may or may not involve direct work with GenAI or LLMs. Without explicit mention of these technologies, it is not clear that the job specifically involves working with them.",
