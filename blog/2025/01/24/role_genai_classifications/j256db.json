  "responsibilities": [
    "Work with a creative team responsible for the bring-up of new hardware platforms (vehicles, sensors, compute) and for building a multi-platform software stack",
    "Develop software and ML methods to accelerate performance improvement of new platforms in relation to existing mature platforms",
    "Build evaluation tools and infrastructure to measure performance of new platforms in comparison to existing mature platforms"
  ],
  "qualifications": [
    "Programming in C++ with robust and efficient code",
    "Building, integrating, debugging, and evaluating ML-based systems"
  ],
  "analysis": "The job responsibilities involve working with a creative team to develop new hardware platforms and improve their performance using software and machine learning (ML) methods. The focus is on accelerating performance improvement and building evaluation tools for comparison with existing platforms. The skills required include programming in C++ and working with ML-based systems, which suggests a focus on machine learning and software development.\n\nThere is no explicit mention of Generative AI (GenAI) or language models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The job seems to be more about hardware platform development and performance optimization using ML, rather than specifically working with GenAI or LLMs. While ML is a broad field that can include GenAI and LLMs, the description does not provide any specific indication that these technologies are involved in this role.",
