  "responsibilities": [
    "Work with a creative team responsible for the bring-up of new hardware platforms (vehicles, sensors, compute) and building a multi-platform software stack",
    "Develop software and ML methods to accelerate performance improvement of new platforms in relation to existing mature platforms",
    "Build evaluation tools and infrastructure to measure performance of new platforms in comparison to existing mature platforms"
  ],
  "qualifications": [
    "Programming in C++ with robust and efficient code",
    "Building, integrating, debugging, and evaluating ML-based systems"
  ],
  "analysis": "The job responsibilities involve working with a creative team to develop software and machine learning (ML) methods for new hardware platforms, as well as building evaluation tools to measure performance. The skills required include programming in C++ and working with ML-based systems. While the job involves machine learning, there is no specific mention of Generative AI (GenAI) or language models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The focus seems to be on hardware platforms and performance improvement rather than on generative tasks or language processing, which are typical applications of GenAI and LLMs.",
