The tools mentioned include Microsoft tools, Tableau, Databricks, and Snowflake, which are primarily used for data management, analytics, and visualization. The responsibilities also include performing analyses using statistical, machine learning, and applied mathematical techniques, but there is no specific mention of Generative AI or language models. The skills required emphasize proficiency in data tools, communication, organization, and a desire to learn new technologies, but again, there is no direct reference to GenAI or LLMs. The focus is more on data analytics and business intelligence rather than on generative or language model technologies.",
