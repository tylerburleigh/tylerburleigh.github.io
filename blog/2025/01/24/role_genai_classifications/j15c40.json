  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills listed are heavily focused on generative modeling, particularly in the context of video and multimodal diffusion models. The responsibilities include designing novel architectures for large-scale video and multimodal diffusion models, developing new approaches to multimodal fusion, temporal modeling, and video control, and researching techniques for improving training stability at scale. These tasks are indicative of working with Generative AI, as they involve creating and optimizing models that generate content, in this case, video and multimodal content.\n\nThe skills required, such as proficiency in deep learning tools like PyTorch and CUDA, experience with diffusion models, and a deep understanding of attention and transformers, further support the involvement with Generative AI. The mention of training models with 10B+ parameters and expertise in distributed training systems and model parallelism suggests work with large-scale models, which is common in both Generative AI and LLMs.\n\nWhile the job does not explicitly mention language models, the focus on generative modeling, particularly with large-scale models and multimodal architectures, aligns with the broader category of Generative AI, which can include language models as a subset. Therefore, the job likely involves working with Generative AI, and potentially with language models if they are part of the multimodal systems being developed.",
