The responsibilities also include performing analysis for insights, resolving data issues, and improving processes with new tools and technologies. These tasks are generally related to data engineering and business intelligence.\n\nHowever, when examining the skills section, there is a specific mention of \"Experience with statistics, machine learning and generative AI.\" This indicates that the job does involve working with generative AI, as it is explicitly listed as a required skill. While the responsibilities do not directly mention generative AI or language models, the inclusion of generative AI in the skills section suggests that the role may involve tasks related to or utilizing generative AI technologies.\n\nTherefore, based on the skills required, it is reasonable to conclude that the job involves working with generative AI.",
