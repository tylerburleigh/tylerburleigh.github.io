The skills required include attention to detail, understanding of data labeling concepts, communication skills, and Python programming experience. There is no explicit mention of working with Generative AI (GenAI) or language models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The job seems to be more about supporting machine learning projects through data preparation rather than directly involving GenAI or LLMs.",
