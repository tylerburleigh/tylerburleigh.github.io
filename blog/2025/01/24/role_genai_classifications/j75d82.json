  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include working on state-of-the-art GenAI pipelines for image and video generation, delivering generative machine learning experiences on devices, and building augmented reality experiences using generative and diffusion models. These tasks clearly indicate involvement with Generative AI (GenAI), as they focus on creating new content (images, videos, augmented reality experiences) using generative models. The skills required, such as a passion for machine learning, knowledge of deep learning foundations, and the ability to solve open ambiguous problems, align with the expertise needed to work with GenAI technologies. There is no explicit mention of language models or LLMs in the responsibilities or skills, so the job does not specifically involve working with language models.",
