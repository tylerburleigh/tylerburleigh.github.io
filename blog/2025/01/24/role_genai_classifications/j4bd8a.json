The responsibilities focus on building essential tooling, working with a team, and contributing to platform shifts, which are general software engineering tasks. The skills required include picking up new frameworks, working across the stack, and having empathy for developers, which are also typical for software development roles. There is no direct indication that the role involves working with GenAI or LLMs, as there are no mentions of AI, machine learning, or language models in the responsibilities or skills.",
