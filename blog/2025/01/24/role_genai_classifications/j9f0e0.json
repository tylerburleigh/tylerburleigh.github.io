  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include creating awareness through research that educates AI developers, shaping research projects based on recently developed or released AI models, and building a presence in the AI community. These tasks suggest a focus on cutting-edge AI technologies, which likely includes Generative AI and language models. The skills required for the job further support this inference. The job requires working knowledge of generative AI, machine learning, and data science, as well as technical experience with the LLM app development stack, which explicitly mentions agents, orchestration frameworks, and vector databases. These are components commonly associated with the development and deployment of language models. The combination of responsibilities and skills clearly indicates that the job involves working with Generative AI and language models.",
