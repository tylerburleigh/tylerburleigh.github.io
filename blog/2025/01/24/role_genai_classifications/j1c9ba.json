  "qualifications": [
    "Knowledge of deep learning and neural networks.",
    "Experience working with machine learning libraries like Pytorch.",
    "Familiarity with scripting languages such as Python and shell scripts.",
    "Ability to solve complex problems and compare alternative solutions, tradeoffs, and diverse points of view to determine a path forward.",
    "Experience working and communicating cross functionally in a team environment."
  ],
  "analysis": "The job responsibilities explicitly mention working with \"state of the art LLMs and assistants\" and \"train state of the large language models (LLM) on large data,\" which directly indicates involvement with language models. Additionally, the responsibility to \"perform research to tackle unsolved real-world problems\" and \"drive applied research that can be applied to Meta product development\" suggests a focus on advancing technology, which is consistent with working on Generative AI or language models.\n\nThe skills required include \"knowledge of deep learning and neural networks\" and \"experience working with machine learning libraries like Pytorch,\" both of which are essential for developing and training language models and Generative AI systems. The mention of \"familiarity with scripting languages such as Python\" is also relevant, as Python is commonly used in AI and machine learning development.\n\nOverall, the job clearly involves working with Generative AI and language models, as indicated by the responsibilities and skills listed.",
