  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include designing user interfaces for AI solutions that pass prompt values to trained models, fine-tuning models to meet specific business needs, and developing multi-modal AI solutions involving text prompts, voice, imagery, and data. These tasks suggest working with AI models that can process and generate text, which is a characteristic of language models or Generative AI. Additionally, the responsibility of training machine learning custom classification models to analyze narrative comments indicates the use of natural language processing, which is often associated with language models.\n\nThe skills required for the job include experience with natural language processing (NLP), which is a key component of language models and Generative AI. The mention of deep learning, TensorFlow, and Python also aligns with the development and fine-tuning of language models. Furthermore, the experience in building AI solutions involving images and sentiment analysis suggests a broader application of AI, which can include Generative AI capabilities.\n\nOverall, the combination of responsibilities and skills indicates that the job involves working with Generative AI or language models, as it requires developing and fine-tuning models that handle text and other modalities, as well as utilizing NLP techniques.",
