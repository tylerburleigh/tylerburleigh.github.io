The skills required include SQL, data warehousing, data modeling, Hadoop, Hive, and machine learning. These responsibilities and skills are centered around data engineering, data analysis, and data infrastructure. There is no mention of working with Generative AI or language models (LLMs) specifically. The focus is more on data processing, ETL frameworks, and data-driven decision-making rather than on natural language processing or generation tasks that would typically involve GenAI or LLMs.",
