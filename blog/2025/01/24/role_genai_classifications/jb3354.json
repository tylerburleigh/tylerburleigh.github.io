  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills clearly indicate involvement with Generative AI and language models. The responsibilities mention \"Building AI Agents\" and \"Mentoring other engineers on best practices and architectural principles when developing with LLMs,\" which directly points to working with language models. Additionally, the skills section includes \"Deep understanding of successful prompt engineering techniques,\" \"Experience fine-tuning LLMs,\" and \"Keen eye for emergent UX patterns with generative AI interactions,\" all of which are specific to working with Generative AI and language models. The mention of \"Experience with RAG and Multi-Agency design\" and \"Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, GoLang, Rust, etc.\" further supports the involvement with AI technologies, particularly those related to language models.",
