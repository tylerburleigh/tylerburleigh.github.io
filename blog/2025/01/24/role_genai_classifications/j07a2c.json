  "analysis": "The job responsibilities primarily focus on engineering project management, design, and technical calculations. The tasks include determining project scope, technical design criteria, performing design calculations, preparing sketches, and overseeing the work of technicians and designers. There is a strong emphasis on traditional engineering practices, coordination, and documentation. The skills required include technical expertise in engineering, proficiency in programming languages for embedded and real-time applications, and the ability to communicate complex technical concepts. There is no mention of working with Generative AI, language models, or any related technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, or AI-driven design tools. The focus is on engineering and project management rather than AI or language model development or application.",
