  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills clearly indicate involvement with Generative AI and language models. The responsibilities mention building and launching generative AI solutions using Meta\u2019s Llama and other state-of-the-art LLMs, which directly points to working with language models. Additionally, there is a focus on driving adoption of Llama and other AI/ML platform offerings, which are related to language models. The job also involves working with cloud providers on deep learning and Llama integrations, optimizing generative AI models, and providing thought leadership on Llama  Generative AI services. \n\nThe skills required for the job further support this analysis. There is a specific mention of experience with at least one LLM such as Llama, GPT, Claude, Falcon, etc., which are all examples of language models. The job also requires experience with deep learning frameworks, which are commonly used in developing and deploying language models. \n\nOverall, both the responsibilities and skills strongly indicate that the job involves working with Generative AI and language models.",
