  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include building low-code/no-code GenAI Platform tools using ServiceNow Platform capabilities and frameworks. The mention of \"GenAI Platform tools\" directly indicates that the job involves working with Generative AI. The other responsibilities focus on software development best practices, product design, and mentoring, which are common in many software engineering roles. However, the specific mention of GenAI tools is a clear indicator of involvement with Generative AI.\n\nThe skills listed do not explicitly mention Generative AI or language models, but they include general software development skills such as JavaScript, UI frameworks, and design skills. These skills are relevant to building and working with GenAI tools, especially in a platform development context.\n\nOverall, the explicit mention of building GenAI Platform tools in the responsibilities confirms that the job involves working with Generative AI.",
