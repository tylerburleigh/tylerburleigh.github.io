  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills listed do not explicitly mention Generative AI (GenAI) or language models (LLMs). The responsibilities focus on technical leadership, backend development, collaboration with data science teams, and working on enterprise applications. While there is mention of working closely with data science and data engineering teams, and building a backend REST server for machine learning and BI data, there is no direct reference to GenAI or LLMs.\n\nThe skills required include expertise in Python, NodeJS, Typescript, relational database design, and experience with tools like Dagster and Airflow. These skills are relevant to software engineering and data engineering but do not specifically indicate work with GenAI or LLMs.\n\nOverall, while the job involves working with data science and machine learning, there is no clear indication that it specifically involves Generative AI or language models.",
