The responsibilities focus on software design, product development, collaboration with various teams, and building software prototypes and interfaces. The skills required include knowledge of software engineering languages, development on multiple platforms, and understanding of agile development processes. There is no direct reference to working with AI models, natural language processing, or any specific tasks related to GenAI or LLMs. The focus seems to be more on general software development and product design rather than AI-specific tasks.",
