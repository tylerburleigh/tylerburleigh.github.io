    "Design and implement methods to evaluate media generation and editing capabilities.",
    "Establish evaluation processes ranging from offline evaluation, data mining, third-party evaluation, and automated solutions.",
    "Work with a large and globally distributed team across multiple functions to understand needs and align on goals and outcomes.",
    "Play a significant role in healthy cross-functional collaboration."
  ],
  "qualifications": [
    "Ability to design and implement evaluation methods for media models.",
    "Proficiency in programming, particularly in Python.",

  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include designing and implementing methods to evaluate media generation and editing capabilities, which suggests involvement with generative models, particularly those that handle media such as images or videos. The skills required include the ability to design and implement evaluation methods for media models, proficiency in programming (Python), and experience with frameworks like PyTorch, which are commonly used in developing and evaluating machine learning models, including generative models. Additionally, the job requires strong research skills in AI, machine learning, vision, and deep learning, which are relevant to generative AI tasks. However, there is no explicit mention of language models or tasks specifically related to natural language processing, which are typically associated with LLMs. The focus seems to be more on media generation and evaluation rather than language generation or processing.",
