  "analysis": "The job responsibilities focus on quality engineering for software products, including building quality frameworks, developing test automation, and leading testing efforts. The skills required include a strong technical background in software QA/QE, proficiency in programming and scripting languages, and experience with AI/ML in quality engineering. While there is mention of AI/ML, it is in the context of using tools like Selenium with ML add-ons and familiarity with machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. There is no specific mention of working with Generative AI (GenAI) or language models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The focus is more on general AI/ML applications in quality engineering rather than on GenAI or LLMs.",
