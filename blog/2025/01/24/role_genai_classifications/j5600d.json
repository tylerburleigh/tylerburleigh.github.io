  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include participating in an embodied AI research project, implementing algorithms for proposed models and applications, and working closely with researchers. These responsibilities suggest a focus on AI research and development, which could potentially involve Generative AI or language models. The skills required for the job include experience in training or inference using Large Language Models (LLMs), which directly indicates that the job involves working with language models. Additionally, the requirement for good knowledge of Deep Learning components and strong coding skills in Python, along with experience in Pytorch, further supports the involvement with advanced AI models, including LLMs.",
