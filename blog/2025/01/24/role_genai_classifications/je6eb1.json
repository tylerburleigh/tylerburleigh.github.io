  "analysis": "The job involves working with Generative AI systems, specifically for AR Effect Generation, which is a type of Generative AI. The responsibilities include designing and implementing features for AI Effect Generation, which suggests the use of generative models to create interactive experiences. The mention of inference stage techniques such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), CoT (Chain of Thought), and Prompt Engineering indicates the use of advanced techniques often associated with language models and generative AI. The skills required include expertise in Generative AI, which directly points to working with generative models. While the job does not explicitly mention language models or LLMs, the use of techniques like RAG and Prompt Engineering suggests that there may be some overlap or use of language models in the generative process.",
