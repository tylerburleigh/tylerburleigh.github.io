  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills listed are primarily focused on mass spectrometry, assay development, protein characterization, and analytical method development. The tasks involve operating and troubleshooting mass spectrometers, conducting scientific research for drug development, and participating in technology transfer and process comparability studies. The skills required include knowledge of mass spectrometry, peptide mapping, and data analysis/visualization tools like Python and R. There is no mention of working with Generative AI (GenAI) or language models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The focus is on scientific research and analytical techniques related to mass spectrometry and protein characterization, rather than AI or language models.",
