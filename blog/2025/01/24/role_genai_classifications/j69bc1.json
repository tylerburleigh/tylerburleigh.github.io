  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include building low-code/no-code GenAI Platform tools using ServiceNow Platform capabilities and frameworks. The explicit mention of \"GenAI Platform tools\" indicates that the job involves working with Generative AI. The other responsibilities focus on software engineering best practices, user experience, and product development, which are common in many software engineering roles. However, the specific mention of GenAI tools is a clear indicator of involvement with Generative AI.\n\nThe skills required for the job include a passion for JavaScript, experience with modern UI frameworks, and analytical and design skills. While these skills are typical for software development roles, they do not specifically indicate work with Generative AI or language models. However, the responsibilities section already provides sufficient evidence of involvement with Generative AI.\n\nOverall, the job involves working with Generative AI, as explicitly stated in the responsibilities.",
