  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills clearly indicate involvement with Generative AI (GenAI) and language models (LLMs). The responsibilities mention working with top applied AI researchers to advance trustworthy GenAI development, which directly points to Generative AI. Additionally, the task of reading and researching the latest LLM evaluation literature and applying findings to product offerings explicitly involves language models.\n\nThe skills required for the job further support this conclusion. The need for strong experience with Generative or Seq-2-Seq Models indicates a focus on generative models, which are a subset of GenAI. The requirement for strong experience with deep learning frameworks like Pytorch, TensorFlow, and Keras, which are commonly used for developing and training language models, also suggests work with LLMs. The emphasis on advanced evaluation techniques in machine learning and strong ML problem-solving skills aligns with the development and evaluation of language models.\n\nOverall, both the responsibilities and skills strongly suggest that the job involves working with Generative AI and language models.",
