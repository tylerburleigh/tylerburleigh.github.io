    "Ability to convert functional logic into code.",
    "Experience designing and implementing APIs and microservices.",

  "analysis": "The job responsibilities focus on building and maintaining functional pipelines, designing architecture, integrating machine learning models, and collaborating with engineering teams. While there is mention of integrating machine learning models, there is no specific mention of working with Generative AI or language models. The skills required include software engineering principles, Python, SQL, and experience with APIs and microservices, but again, there is no direct reference to GenAI or LLMs. The job seems to be more focused on general software development and machine learning integration rather than specifically working with Generative AI or language models.",
