  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include developing and implementing AI models to solve complex problems, which suggests a focus on advanced AI technologies. The skills section explicitly mentions experience with deep learning techniques, including natural language processing and LLMs (Large Language Models). The mention of LLMs directly indicates that the job involves working with language models. Additionally, the requirement for staying up-to-date with AI developments and applying state-of-the-art machine learning technologies further supports the involvement with cutting-edge AI, which could include Generative AI (GenAI) models. Therefore, the job likely involves working with both Generative AI and language models.",
