  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include \"Rapid prototyping of AI agents and generative AI experiences,\" \"Development of LLM-powered products,\" and \"Apply and extend state-of-the-art techniques across the full spectrum of generative AI.\" These clearly indicate involvement with Generative AI and language models. Additionally, the responsibility to \"Evaluate, measure, and improve performance on a continuous basis\" suggests ongoing work with AI systems, likely involving LLMs.\n\nThe skills section mentions a \"Proven track record of shipping products powered by LLMs, RAG systems, and/or AI agents,\" which directly points to experience with language models. The emphasis on \"pushing the boundaries of AI\" and \"staying at the cutting edge of industry trends and technologies\" further supports the focus on advanced AI technologies, including GenAI and LLMs.\n\nOverall, both the responsibilities and skills strongly indicate that the job involves working with Generative AI and language models.",
