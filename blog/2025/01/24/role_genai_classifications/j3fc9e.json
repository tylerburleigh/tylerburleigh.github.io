  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include prototyping and experimenting with new AI features, productionizing and launching new AI technology integrations, and staying up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends. These responsibilities suggest a focus on AI development and integration, which could involve Generative AI or language models.\n\nThe skills required for the job include expertise in building and prototyping AI products using LLMs, embeddings, and other ML technologies. The explicit mention of LLMs (Large Language Models) indicates that the job involves working with language models. Additionally, the requirement for expertise in embeddings, which are often used in conjunction with language models, further supports this conclusion.\n\nOverall, both the responsibilities and skills clearly indicate that the job involves working with Generative AI and language models.",
