  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include designing and developing machine learning and Gen AI systems, which explicitly mentions Generative AI (GenAI). This indicates that the role involves working with GenAI technologies. The responsibilities also involve solving complex problems with multilayered data sets, optimizing machine learning libraries, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to build machine learning applications. While the skills section lists proficiency in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch, which are commonly used in developing language models, there is no explicit mention of working with language models or Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically. However, the mention of GenAI in the responsibilities is a clear indicator that the job involves working with Generative AI.",
