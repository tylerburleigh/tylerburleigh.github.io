  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include researching and developing novel computer vision models in Generative AI, with a focus on 3D objects, textures, and scene generation. This clearly indicates involvement with Generative AI, as it specifically mentions the development of models in this area. The skills required include experience with machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, which is commonly used in developing AI models, including Generative AI models. The mathematical background and understanding of numerical optimization, linear algebra, probabilistic estimation, and 3D geometry further support the focus on Generative AI, particularly in the context of computer vision and 3D modeling. There is no mention of language models or tasks typically associated with LLMs, such as natural language processing or text generation.",
