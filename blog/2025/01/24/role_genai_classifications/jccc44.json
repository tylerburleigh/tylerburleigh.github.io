  "analysis": "The job involves designing and conducting machine learning research, collaborating with experimental teams, and delivering production-quality models for drug discovery. The skills required include experience with deep learning models, specifically mentioning large language models (LLMs). This indicates that the job involves working with language models. Additionally, the mention of developing novel AI methods for biomolecular design suggests the potential use of Generative AI (GenAI) techniques. The combination of these responsibilities and skills strongly suggests that the job involves working with both Generative AI and language models.",
