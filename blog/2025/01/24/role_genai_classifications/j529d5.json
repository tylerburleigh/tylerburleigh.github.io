  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include guiding the development of data collection systems that enable training and evaluation of generative AI systems while preserving privacy. This explicitly mentions \"generative AI systems,\" indicating that the job involves working with Generative AI. The other responsibilities focus on privacy, auditing, and communication, which are relevant to the context of working with AI systems, but the key indicator is the direct mention of generative AI. The skills listed, such as creative problem solving and analytical skills, are supportive of roles involving AI, but the primary evidence comes from the responsibilities section.",
