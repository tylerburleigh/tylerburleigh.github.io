  "analysis": "The job responsibilities and skills clearly indicate involvement with language models (LLMs). The responsibilities mention the use of internal and external LLMs to build grading models and integrate them into evaluation pipelines. Additionally, the skills section explicitly lists experience with natural language processing (NLP) and large language models like BERT, GPT, or Transformers, as well as the ability to stay on top of emerging trends in LLMs. These points strongly suggest that the job involves working with language models. While the job does not explicitly mention Generative AI (GenAI), the mention of LLMs, which are often used in generative tasks, implies a potential overlap with GenAI technologies.",
