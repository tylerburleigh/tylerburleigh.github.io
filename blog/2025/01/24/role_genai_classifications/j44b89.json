  "analysis": "The job involves conducting applied research and tool development in areas such as physics-informed neural networks, digital twins, and uncertainty quantification in machine learning. These areas are related to advanced applications of AI but do not specifically mention Generative AI or language models. The responsibilities also include developing and applying novel AI and advanced data science, which could potentially involve GenAI or LLMs, but it is not explicitly stated. The skills required include experience in applied, use-inspired computing focusing on innovative use or development of AI methods, which again could involve GenAI or LLMs, but there is no direct mention of these technologies. Overall, while the job is heavily focused on AI, there is no explicit indication that it involves working with Generative AI or language models.",
