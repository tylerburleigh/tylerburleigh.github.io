  "analysis": "The job responsibilities focus on building and innovating components of the perception stack, which includes datasets, modeling, evaluation, and applications. The mention of \"multimodal models\" suggests working with models that can process and understand multiple types of data, such as images, videos, and text. However, there is no explicit mention of Generative AI or language models (LLMs) in the responsibilities.\n\nThe skills required include driving innovations in deep learning, image/video perception, neural network architectures, and ML systems. These skills are relevant to machine learning and perception tasks but do not specifically indicate working with Generative AI or language models.\n\nOverall, while the job involves advanced machine learning and perception tasks, there is no direct indication that it involves working with Generative AI or language models.",
