  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include building low-code/no-code GenAI Platform tools using ServiceNow Platform capabilities and frameworks. The mention of \"GenAI Platform tools\" directly indicates that the job involves working with Generative AI. The other responsibilities focus on software development best practices, designing user-friendly software, and contributing to product design and implementation, which are typical for software development roles. However, the specific mention of GenAI tools is a clear indicator of involvement with Generative AI.\n\nThe skills required for the job include proficiency in Java or similar languages, experience with modern UI frameworks, and strong analytical and design skills. While these skills are common in software development, they do not specifically point to working with Generative AI or language models. However, the responsibilities section already provides the necessary context to determine the involvement with GenAI.\n\nOverall, the job involves working with Generative AI, as explicitly stated in the responsibilities.",
