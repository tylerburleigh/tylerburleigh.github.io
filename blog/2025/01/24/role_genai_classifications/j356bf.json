  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include performing cutting-edge research to solve real-world problems using foundation model-based technologies. This indicates a focus on advanced AI models, which are often generative in nature. The skills section explicitly mentions hands-on experience with large foundation models such as OpenAI GPT models and LLAMA, which are well-known examples of language models and generative AI. Additionally, the skills required include working with state-of-the-art AI/ML frameworks and toolkits like Pytorch, Tensorflow, Langchain, and AutoGen, which are commonly used in developing and deploying generative AI and language models. The job also involves evaluating AI models or systems, which is a critical aspect of working with generative AI and LLMs. Overall, both the responsibilities and skills strongly indicate that the job involves working with Generative AI and language models.",
