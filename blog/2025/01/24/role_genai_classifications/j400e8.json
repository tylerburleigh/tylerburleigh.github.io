The skills required include proficiency in programming languages like Python, Java, Scala, C++, experience with data science tools on Hadoop/cloud systems, problem-solving, and computer science fundamentals.\n\nThere is no explicit mention of working with Generative AI (GenAI) or language models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The focus is more on fraud analytics, system architecture, and data science tools, which do not inherently imply the use of GenAI or LLMs. While data science can sometimes involve machine learning models, there is no specific indication that this role involves working with generative models or language models.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided responsibilities and skills, it does not appear that this job involves working with Generative AI or language models.",
