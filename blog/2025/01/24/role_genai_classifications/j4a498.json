  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include designing, running, and analyzing scientific experiments to advance the understanding of large language models and their application to cybersecurity tasks. This directly indicates involvement with large language models (LLMs). Additionally, the responsibility to work with external partners to develop novel evaluations to assess the cybersecurity implications of models further suggests working with LLMs.\n\nIn the skills section, there is a specific mention of familiarity with prompting and engineering large language models, which is a clear indication of working with LLMs. The requirement for experience using technical infrastructure to interface effectively with machine learning models also supports the involvement with LLMs.\n\nOverall, both the responsibilities and skills sections strongly indicate that the job involves working with large language models, which are a type of Generative AI.",
