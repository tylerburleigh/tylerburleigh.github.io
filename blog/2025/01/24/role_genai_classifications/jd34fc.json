  "responsibilities": [
    "Train state of the art models, developed both internally and from the community, in production to solve problems for enterprise customers.",
    "Work with product and research teams to identify opportunities for ongoing and upcoming services.",
    "Explore approaches that integrate human feedback and assisted evaluation into existing product lines.",
    "Create state of the art techniques to integrate tool-calling into production-serving LLMs.",
    "Work closely with customers to quickly prototype and build new deep learning models targeted at multi-modal content understanding problems."
  ],
  "qualifications": [
    "Strong skills in NLP, LLMs, and deep learning.",
    "Solid background in algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming.",
    "Experience working with a cloud technology stack (e.g., AWS or GCP) and developing machine learning models in a cloud environment.",
    "Strong high-level programming skills (e.g., Python), frameworks, and tools such as DeepSpeed, Pytorch lightning, kubeflow, TensorFlow, etc.",
    "Strong written and verbal communication skills to operate in a cross-functional team environment."
  ],
  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include training state-of-the-art models, integrating tool-calling into production-serving LLMs, and prototyping deep learning models for multi-modal content understanding. These tasks suggest a focus on advanced machine learning techniques, particularly involving language models. The mention of \"LLMs\" (Large Language Models) directly indicates that the job involves working with language models.\n\nThe skills required for the job further support this conclusion. The job requires strong skills in NLP (Natural Language Processing), LLMs, and deep learning, which are all key components of working with language models and Generative AI. Additionally, the use of frameworks and tools such as DeepSpeed, Pytorch lightning, and TensorFlow, which are commonly used in developing and deploying machine learning models, including LLMs, reinforces the involvement with Generative AI.\n\nOverall, both the responsibilities and skills clearly indicate that the job involves working with Generative AI and language models.",
