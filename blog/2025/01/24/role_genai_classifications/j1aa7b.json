  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include the development of new customer-facing features using ChatGPT and OpenAI API, which are directly related to Generative AI and language models. The mention of \"ChatGPT\" and \"OpenAI API\" explicitly indicates that the job involves working with language models. Additionally, the responsibility to work with the research team to iterate on their latest models further suggests involvement with AI models, likely including LLMs. The skills section mentions an interest in AI/ML, which aligns with the responsibilities involving AI technologies. Overall, the job clearly involves working with Generative AI and language models.",
