  "analysis": "The job responsibilities focus on supporting projects in radiology, digital pathology, genomics, and circulating tumor markers, as well as working with the principal investigator to gather data and assess new AI/ML predictive models for oncology applications. The emphasis is on data acquisition, organization, and visualization to facilitate data-driven science. The skills required include familiarity with image visualization and processing software, problem-solving, communication, and the ability to work in a dynamic environment.\n\nThere is no explicit mention of working with Generative AI (GenAI) or language models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The focus seems to be more on predictive models for oncology applications, which may involve traditional machine learning or AI techniques rather than generative models or language models. The job seems to be more oriented towards data science and AI/ML applications in the medical field rather than specifically involving GenAI or LLMs.",
