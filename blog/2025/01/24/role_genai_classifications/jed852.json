  "analysis": "The job responsibilities include building low-code/no-code GenAI Platform tools using ServiceNow Platform capabilities and frameworks. The explicit mention of \"GenAI Platform tools\" indicates that the job involves working with Generative AI. The other responsibilities focus on software engineering best practices, user experience, and product development, which are common in many software development roles. However, the specific mention of GenAI tools is a clear indicator of involvement with Generative AI.\n\nThe skills required for the job include proficiency in programming languages, experience with modern UI frameworks, and analytical and design skills. While these skills are essential for software development, they do not specifically point to working with Generative AI or language models. However, the responsibilities section already provides the necessary context to determine the involvement with GenAI.\n\nOverall, the job involves working with Generative AI, as indicated by the responsibility to build GenAI Platform tools.",
