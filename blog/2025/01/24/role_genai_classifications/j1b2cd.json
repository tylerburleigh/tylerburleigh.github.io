The skills required include expertise in Generative AI and Graphics technologies, collaboration with cross-functional teams, and strong research and development skills in AR effect creation tools.\n\nThe mention of \"Generative AI\" in the skills section indicates that the job involves working with Generative AI technologies. However, there is no specific mention of language models or Large Language Models (LLMs) in the responsibilities or skills. The focus is more on AR effects and graphics technologies rather than language processing or generation, which are typically associated with LLMs.\n\nTherefore, while the job involves working with Generative AI, it does not specifically involve working with language models or LLMs.",
