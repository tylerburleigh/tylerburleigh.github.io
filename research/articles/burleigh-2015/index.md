## Abstract

This commentary responds to MacDorman & Entezari's study on individual differences predicting sensitivity to the uncanny valley. It argues for the importance of examining individual-level response patterns rather than relying on group-level analyses when studying uncanny valley sensitivity, challenging whether aggregate-level findings about individual differences in uncanny valley responses adequately capture the heterogeneity of individual response patterns.
